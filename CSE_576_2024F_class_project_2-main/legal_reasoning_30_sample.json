			"context": "Under federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000. The state citizenship of a person—as opposed to that of a corporation—is determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The ‘‘residence’’ requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish ‘‘residence’’ in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don’t have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there ‘‘indefinitely,’’ that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her ‘‘home.’’ She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn’t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn’t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn’t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn’t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite ‘‘indefinite’’ intent",
			"question": "Marla, who grew up in Montana, moved to Colorado after high school to enter a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. She wasn’t sure if she really wanted to be a stylist, but she was anxious to get away from home, and her parents agreed to foot the bill, so off she went. She figured she’d stay if she liked it, and get a job as a stylist afterwards, in Denver or elsewhere in the West (including Montana). Or she would leave the program if she didn’t like it and look for work, hopefully in Denver. She took an apartment on a six-month lease. After moving to Denver, Marla",
			"options": "A. remains domiciled in Montana, because the program is only for two years. B. remains domiciled in Montana, because she may return there to work as a stylist.  C. remains domiciled in Montana, because she was domiciled there before she left for Denver.  D. is domiciled in Colorado, because she resides there with the intent to remain indefinitely.",
			"ground_truth": "Don’t be fooled by A. Although Marla’s program is for two years, that doesn’t mean that Marla will be there only for two years. The question indicates that she might stay in Denver after finishing the program, or she might leave for a job in some other Western state. Or, she might leave the program if she doesn’t like it and stay in Denver. Thus, she may leave Colorado, or she may not. Since she is not definitely planning to leave Colorado at the end of the program, her stay is not clearly limited to the two years of her academic program. How about B? It sounds seductively reasonable. But the test for domicile isn’t whether you might someday go back to the state from which you came. The test is your attitude toward the state where you are. If you live in a state indefinitely, you acquire a domicile there, even if you think you might go somewhere else, or back where you came from, at some point in the future. Here, Marla’s state of mind is that, whether she finishes the program or not, she may stay in Colorado, or she may leave. That certainly does not show an intent to leave at a definite time. She is in the state with no definite plans to leave. The possibility that Marla might move on at some time in the future does not make her current stay a ‘‘definite’’ one. She might leave Colorado, or she might not. That’s ‘‘indefinite’’ intent. C would only be right if Marla has not established a new domicile in Colorado. If she went to Denver for a fixed period, she would retain her Montana domicile. However, if she’s in Denver without definite plans to leave, she establishes a new domicile there. The facts suggest that her stay is open-ended, so she has established a Colorado domicile. D takes the prize."

			"context": "The most fundamental point about arising-under jurisdiction is that many cases that involve federal issues do not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law. This is the essential message of that civil procedure chestnut, Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908). In Mottley, the plaintiffs sued the railroad for breach of contract, and alleged in their complaint that the railroad had breached the contract because it believed that a federal statute prohibited it from renewing their passes for free travel. In fact, when it answered the complaint, the railroad did rely on the federal statute as their justification for denying the passes. The parties then litigated that federal question and the federal trial court held that the federal statute did not bar renewing the passes. The United States Supreme Court reversed and ordered the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that a case only ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, within the meaning of the federal statute granting arising-under jurisdiction, if the plaintiff relies on federal law as the source of her right to relief. That wasn’t true in Mottley: the plaintiffs had sued for breach of contract, a state law claim. Although a federal issue was litigated, because the railroad raised a defense based on federal law, the plaintiffs did not base their claim on federal law. The fundamental premise of the Mottley rule is that we must assess the federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction based on the plaintiff’s complaint. There is no inherent reason why this must be so. Presumably, the court could wait to see whether the defendant’s answer raises defenses based on federal law, or asserts a counterclaim under federal law, and allow the court to hear the case if she does. Such later pleadings may inject important federal issues into the case, as they did in Mottley. There’s a good argument that this would be a sensible interpretation of the arising-under statute. Indeed, the American Law Institute recommended some years ago that removal be authorized where the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a federal law defense. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, §1312(a)(2) (1969). But Mottley is still a good law in the federal courts. Here’s a fairly straightforward question that illustrates the point.",
			"question": "Consolidated Corporation sues Garces, a former employee, for business libel, a tort claim. The suit is brought in federal court, and alleges that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated was using watered-down concrete on a federal construction project. Garces answers, admitting that he had made a report to the agency, but alleging that his report was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right of free speech. He also files a counterclaim against Consolidated, based on the Federal Whistleblower Act, which authorizes damages for anyone who is dismissed or disciplined for reporting fraud on the federal government. After answering the complaint, Garces moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Assume that there is no jurisdiction based on diversity.) The motion should be",
			"options":"A. granted, because the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case.  B. denied, because the complaint alleges that Garces reported the violations to a federal agency.  C. denied, because the case involves a question arising under the Constitution of the United States.  D. denied, because Garces’s counterclaim arises under federal law.  E. denied, because Garces waived his objection to jurisdiction by answering the complaint and asserting a counterclaim against Consolidated.",
			"ground_truth": "While it might make sense to allow federal jurisdiction whenever an issue of federal law is raised in a suit, this has not been the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the arising-under statute. Under Mottley, we don’t consider federal questions injected into the case by the defendant. Consequently, C is wrong; the fact that the case involves a federal question isn’t enough to satisfy Mottley. We need to look at the plaintiff’s claim only. Here, the law that creates Consolidated’s right to sue is libel law, which is state tort law; the federal law issue only enters the case as a defense. D is wrong for the same reason. Just as we don’t consider federal defenses raised in the answer, we don’t consider counterclaims (that is, claims for relief asserted by the defendant against the plaintiff) in assessing arising-under jurisdiction. One irony here is that Garces could just as well have been the plaintiff in this dispute. Both parties had claims against the other. If Garces had filed suit first, his claim under the Federal Whistleblower Act would have supported federal arising-under jurisdiction. But he didn’t file first, and under Mottley the court will only consider Consolidated’s claim in assessing its jurisdiction. Consequently, Garces will end up litigating his federal law defense and counterclaim in state court. A is the correct answer. When I test this issue, I always like to have one choice in which there’s a vague federal presence that is not directly the source of the claims in the action. Here, B is wrong because the fact that the report was made to a federal agency doesn’t mean that Consolidated’s claim arises under federal law. There’s a vague federal flavor here, but if we ask what Consolidated is suing Garces for, the answer is, for libel, a claim arising under state law. Under Mottley, such peripheral involvement of federal law will not suffice to support jurisdiction. See, however, Section C below, which illustrates a situation in which a federal issue embedded in a state claim may support jurisdiction. E is emphatically wrong, because an objection to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the case. If the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it must dismiss, even if the defendant wants the court to hear it, asserts her defenses and counterclaims, and proceeds to litigate there. Mottley, in which the parties litigated to judgment in the trial court and appealed, illustrates the point. Although the parties wanted the Court to reach the merits, it dismissed because the federal trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case."

			"context":"The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court’s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. §1441(a) provides that ‘‘any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction’’ may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, §2? If not, it can’t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here’s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.",
			"question":"Castor Chemical Company, a California company, sues Pollux, from California, in state court for breach of contract, claiming that Pollux agreed to manufacture a drug for Castor and then reneged. Pollux answers the complaint, admitting that he refused to deliver the drug, and offering as an affirmative defense that he learned, after making the contract, that the drug was covered by a patent, so that, under federal patent law, he could not manufacture it without a license to do so. After answering, Pollux removed the action to federal court",
			"options":"A. The action is properly removed, because at the time he was removed, Pollux had raised a federal law issue in his answer. B. The action is properly removed, because the case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law within the meaning of that phrase in Article III, §2. C. The action is not properly removed, because it is a federal question case, not a diversity case. D. The action is not properly removed, because the case does not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1331.",
			"ground_truth":"The third choice, C, is particularly illogical. Under 28 U.S.C. §1441(a), cases may be removed to federal court if they are within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts. Cases arising under federal law are within the federal courts’ jurisdiction, so they, like diversity cases, may be removed under §1441(a). The other three options are closer. A appears to rest on the premise that a case may be removed whenever it is clear that a federal issue will be litigated in the action. But that isn’t the standard under §1441(a); under that section, the case can only be removed if it could have been filed originally in federal court. As we belabored in the previous chapter, many cases that involve federal law cannot be filed in federal court. Witness poor Erasmus and Annie Mottley’s case. The test for removal is whether the plaintiff could have filed the case initially in federal court, not whether some federal issue is likely to arise or has arisen in the action. This case could not have been filed in federal court, for the same reason that the Mottleys’ action was thrown out by the Supreme Court: it arises under state contract law. There’s a difference between this example and Mottley, however. Here, at the time of removal, the defendant had actually asserted the federal defense in his answer. Thus, the federal issue is already in the case; there is no need to speculate as to whether a federal issue will be litigated in the action. However, this does not change the result. The removal statute provides that only cases that could have been filed originally in federal court may be removed. Castor could not have filed this action in federal court, because it arises under state law and the parties are not diverse. So, the terms of the removal statute itself bar removal here. A is wrong. This point is the key to B as well. It is true that this case arises under federal law within the meaning of Article III, §2, as expounded by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn. Pollux has injected a ‘‘federal ingredient’’ into the case by raising a federal defense. But under §1441(a) the case may only be removed if it could have been filed in federal court. And we know that to file a case in federal court, it must not only fall within the scope of the Article III grant, but must also be conveyed to the federal district court by statute. Castor’s case is within the Article III grant, but it is not within the statutory grant of arising-under jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. §1331. Under Mottley, the plaintiff’s complaint must rely on federal law as the source of his right to relief, to ‘‘arise under’’ federal law within the meaning of §1331. The court will not look at the defendant’s answer in determining whether the claim arises under federal law. So the case could not have been brought in federal court initially, and therefore cannot be removed. D is the winner."

			"context":"The early law of personal jurisdiction, represented by Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877), based personal jurisdiction on physical power over the defendant, at least in cases against individuals. The logic was that a court had the authority to exert physical power over a defendant within the territory of the state where the court sat. The court could order a sheriff to seize and detain the defendant if he found her within the state. So, the logic proceeded, if the sheriff asserted that authority symbolically (refers to the act of Sheriff serving legal documents to the defendant), by serving the defendant with process in the state, rather than actually arresting her, the court would acquire jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and could enter a judgment against her if she were found liable (This means that the defendant was served legal papers (such as a summons and complaint) when he/she was within the geographic boundaries of the state. When this service is done within the state, it typically establishes the court’s personal jurisdiction over the defendant.). Here’s a quick example to illustrate Pennoyer’s ‘‘presence theory’’ of personal jurisdiction.",
			"question":"Neff hired Mitchell, a lawyer, in Oregon to sue Jones for breach of contract. Neff agreed to pay Mitchell $300 for his services. Mitchell did the work, but Neff left the state for California and didn’t pay Mitchell’s fee. Mitchell sues Neff for his fee in an Oregon state court, and has Neff served with process in Oregon while Neff was visiting there on unrelated business. Neff promptly departed once more for California and has not returned to the state since. Under personal jurisdiction theory as expounded in Pennoyer, the Oregon court",
			"options":"A. has personal jurisdiction over Neff. B. does not have personal jurisdiction over Neff, because he was served while he was there for a purpose unrelated to the fees claim. C. does not have jurisdiction over Neff, because he is no longer physically present in Oregon. D. has jurisdiction over Neff for the fees claim, but would not have jurisdiction over him if Mitchell had sued him for a claim that arose in another state.",
			"ground_truth":"This question makes the basic point about Pennoyer: that jurisdiction was acquired by the symbolic act of in-state service of process, and that once in-state service was made, the court acquired the power to adjudicate the case for which process was served. The distractors reflect various misconceptions about this principle. C suggests that, for the court to litigate the case, the defendant must not only have been served with process in the state, but remain in the state while the case proceeded. Not so. The logic of Pennoyer was that a defendant within the state was subject to the sheriff’s (and the court’s) power to arrest. Under early English practice, the local sheriff may actually have arrested the defendant and held her pending resolution of the case, or at least had the power to do so. Later, actual arrest of the defendant gave way to symbolic seizure, through personal delivery of the court papers in the suit. However, the premise was that this symbolic seizure subjected the defendant to the court’s authority, not just at the moment of service, but on an ongoing basis. The court’s power, once properly asserted by service of process within the forum state, continued throughout the litigation. Neff could leave after he was served if he wanted, but that would not prevent the court from proceeding with the case once it had acquired jurisdiction. B fails as well. It suggests that Neff could only be subjected to jurisdiction through in-state service if he was in the state for some reason connected to the plaintiff’s claim. But the logic of Pennoyer was that a defendant present within the forum state was subject to the authority of that state’s courts, without regard to why he was there. Jurisdiction was based on symbolic arrest, not on any relationship between Neff’s reason for being in Oregon and the lawsuit. He could be there to play the lottery, to visit the zoo, or to be inaugurated as governor; it wouldn’t matter. His presence when served was the key, not the reason for that presence. D also comes up short. It suggests that jurisdiction could be based on service of process in the state, but that the court would only acquire jurisdiction by in-state service to adjudicate claims that arose within the state. This is another misconception. If Mitchell filed suit in Oregon, and served Neff with the papers for that suit in Oregon, it didn’t matter what the claim was for. It could be for an auto accident in Maine, a property dispute in Texas, or lies told about him in Minnesota. Jurisdiction was not based on any relation between the claim and the state; it was based on the premise that the court could exert judicial power over a person physically present there. (After all, if Neff never came back to Oregon, Mitchell would have to sue him in California under Pennoyer’s approach, and the California court would then exercise jurisdiction over Neff, even though the claim Mitchell sued upon arose in Oregon.) So A is the winner. If Mitchell managed to serve Neff with the papers initiating the suit in Oregon, under Pennoyer the Oregon court obtained jurisdiction over Neff for that suit, and leaving wouldn’t deprive the court of authority to proceed. Once jurisdiction attached, it continued, even though the sheriff, after ‘‘catching’’ Neff in the state, let him go."

			"context":"The previous chapter iterates, and reiterates, that jurisdiction (When we talk about 'jurisdiction,' we're discussing whether a court has the authority to make legal decisions about a person or company.) based on a defendant’s ‘‘minimum contacts’’ with the forum is limited to claims that arise out of those contacts. If a defendant conducts limited activities directed to the forum state (the term 'forum state' refers to the state where the court is located and where the lawsuit is being filed. It's the state whose courts are being asked to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant.), it is subject to ‘‘specific’’ personal jurisdiction for claims arising out of those contacts, but not for other claims that arise in other states. However, in International Shoe the Court suggested that a defendant’s contacts in the state may sometimes be so extensive that it could be sued there for any claim against it, no matter where it arose. ‘‘[T]here have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.’’ 326 U.S at 318. The premise behind general in personam jurisdiction is that, where a defendant’s contacts are sufficiently extensive in the forum state, it is neither unfair nor inconvenient to require it to defend any lawsuit there, including ones that arise in other states. Thus, if International Shoe is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Missouri, it could be sued there for unemployment taxes due in Washington, or breach of a contract in Colorado. This is analogous to general in personam jurisdiction over an individual defendant based on her domicile in the state. In Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457 (1940), the Supreme Court affirmed that a person’s domicile is such an important connection to a state, and confers sufficient benefits, that an individual domiciled in a state may fairly be required to defend any claim in that state. Let’s start by distinguishing assertions of general in personam jurisdiction from other exercises of jurisdiction. Consider the following question.",
			"question": "In which of the following cases could the court rely on general in personam jurisdiction as the basis for exercising judicial authority over the defendant?",
			"options": "A. Johnston brings an action in New Mexico against Moreno, a Texas citizen, for breach of a contract they entered into in Texas, in which Moreno agreed to sell Johnston a painting. He obtains jurisdiction by attaching a time share Moreno owns at a condominium complex in the New Mexico mountains. B. Truscott sues Mancini Motors, a Texas corporation that sells antique cars at its dealerships in Texas and California. Truscott sues in New Mexico, for injuries he suffered in New Mexico while driving a 1964 Ford Mustang that Mancini had advertised in New Mexico, sold to Truscott, and shipped to him in New Mexico. Truscott serves Mancini with process in the action at the Texas dealership. Mancini has no place of business in New Mexico, but sells three or four cars a year there. C. Truscott sues Mancini Motors, the Texas antique car company, in Texas. He seeks damages for misrepresentations a Mancini salesperson made to him at a Mancini dealership in California, which led him to purchase a car at the California dealership. D. Cartwright sues Skilful Electric Tool Company in Michigan for injuries he suffered there using a Skilful saw he bought in Michigan. Skilful is incorporated in Delaware, manufactures its saws in Tennessee, where its home offices are, and sells its saws to wholesalers around the United States. Its main wholesaler, Statewide Distributors, is located in Michigan. Skilful sells 40 percent of its saws to Statewide, and ships them to Statewide in Michigan. Statewide sells at least half of those saws in Michigan.",
			"ground_truth": "In A, jurisdiction is not based on general in personam jurisdiction. Indeed, it is not based on in personam jurisdiction at all. It is an exercise of in rem jurisdiction, based not on bringing the defendant before the court, but upon the seizure of his property by attachment to satisfy an unrelated claim. More on this later in the chapter. Note too, that the defendant in this case is an individual. General in personam jurisdiction based on extensive contacts (as opposed to domicile) may not apply to individual defendants at all, but only to corporations. See Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 610 n.1 (1990). B involves an exercise of specific in personam jurisdiction. Surely, selling a few cars a year in New Mexico is insufficient to support general in personam jurisdiction, which rests on the premise that the defendant conducts continuous, extensive activity in the forum state. However, Truscott’s claim here arises out of a minimum contact of Mancini in New Mexico: advertising the car there and subsequently selling it to Truscott there. This would support specific in personam jurisdiction, since Truscott’s claim arises out of a sale actively solicited by Mancini in New Mexico. D is also a specific in personam case. Here, Cartwright sues for a claim that arises out of sales of Skilful’s products into Michigan. Even after Asahi and McIntyre, Skilful would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Michigan for this claim since Skilful directly cultivated the Michigan market for its products by selling saws in quantity in Michigan, and Cartwright’s claim arises from a product sold into Michigan. But Skilful’s contacts would almost certainly not support general in personam jurisdiction in Michigan. In Daimler A.G. v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the Supreme Court held that a corporation is only subject to general in personam jurisdiction in states where it is ‘‘at home.’’ In almost all cases, Daimler held, a corporation is ‘‘at home’’ only in the state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business. Michigan probably does not meet that test, even though Skilful does a lot of business there. Nor would Cartwright need to invoke general in personam jurisdiction, since the claim arises out of a Skilful contact in the forum. C is different. Here, Truscott sues Mancini in Texas for a claim that arose from its activity in California. Mancini has plenty of contacts in Texas, but this claim does not arise from them. If the court is to exercise jurisdiction in the case, it will have to do so based on the fact that Mancini, which is incorporated in Texas and has a permanent place of business there, has extensive contacts in Texas that support general in personam jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over any claim against the corporation, even if it arose in another state. Go with C."

			"context": "Let’s start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court’s power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property ‘‘without due process of law,’’ that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it’s a court that’s doing the depriving—by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it—basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have ‘‘a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction’’ over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being ‘‘at home’’ in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That’s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (‘‘No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.’’) It says to the states, ‘‘go ahead, define your courts’ jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don’t overreach.’’ It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant’s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps. First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant. Second, if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second question: whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.",
			"question":"Perrone, an Acadia resident, sues Margules, a Montanan, in an Acadia state court, for defamation. He claims that Margules called Acme Corporation, an Acadia company that was planning to hire Perrone, and made false and defamatory statements about his professional abilities that led Acme to decide not to hire him. Margules placed the call from her office in Montana. Assume that Acadia has a long-arm statute that authorizes personal jurisdiction over a defendant who ‘‘causes personal injury in this state by a tortious act or omission while physically present within this state.’’ Assume that this is the only statute that might authorize the Acadia court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Perrone for this claim.",
			"options":"A. The Acadia statute authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. However, it would be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. B. The Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. In addition, it would be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. C. The Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. However, it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. D. Although the Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case, the court may do so because the claim arises out of her deliberate contacts with Acadia that gave rise to Perrone’s claim.",
			"ground_truth":"It shouldn’t be too hard to narrow down the choices here. The statute requires that the defendant, when she commits the tortious act, be physically present in Acadia. Margules wasn’t, so the statute does not authorize the Acadia court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Margules. That eliminates A right off the bat. B asserts that the statute does not authorize the court to hear the case, and that, if it did, it would exceed constitutional bounds to exercise jurisdiction over Margules on these facts. This is almost certainly not so. Margules deliberately reached into Acadia to cause a substantial adverse effect on Perrone in Acadia, and did. A person need not physically enter a state to establish a minimum contact there that will support personal jurisdiction over her. She need only purposely engage in conduct focused on the state that she can foresee might cause adverse effects there and lead to litigation there. Margules certainly did that, and it would not be unreasonable to require her to defend this Acadia-focused act in Acadia. Compare Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984) (Florida defendant who wrote defamatory article about California actress published there subject to personal jurisdiction in California, even if he did not travel to California in connection with the article). How about D, which suggests that the court can exercise jurisdiction because Margules’s minimum contacts in Acadia would constitutionally allow the court to do so? This dangerously misconstrues the relation of jurisdictional statutes and constitutional constraints. Although it would be consistent with due process for Acadia to require Margules to defend this case in Acadia, it has chosen not to require him to. Instead, it has written a long-arm statute that does not ‘‘reach to the limits of due process.’’ In this long-arm provision, Acadia has granted its courts less personal jurisdiction authority than it constitutionally could, by excluding cases like Perrone’s, in which communications from outside the state defame a plaintiff in the state. Maybe it just doesn’t want to hear all these cases. For whatever reason, it has not given its courts statutory authority to hear this claim, even though it could have. C is the best answer."

This case doesn’t belong here; throw it out.’’ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court’s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the ‘‘special appearance.’’ The defendant would ‘‘appear specially’’ for the sole purpose of objecting to the court’s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court’s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court’s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have ‘‘appeared generally,’’ waiving her special appearance and accepting the court’s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff’s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a ‘‘special appearance’’ had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court’s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there’s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant’s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn’t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should—very carefully—enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here’s a question to test the point. I’ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you’ve read the discussion above it should be easy.",
			"question":"Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito’s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court’s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would",
			"options":"A. hear and decide the jurisdictional objection, since Ito has properly raised the objection by making a special appearance. B. conclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue. C. consider both objections, since it would apply the Massachusetts approach to raising jurisdictional objections. D. conclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him.",
			"ground_truth":"By the way, here’s a quick point on exam-taking strategy, which I may already have made but is worth repeating. The question asks you to assume that Nevada follows the special appearance approach. Suppose that you happen to know that Nevada doesn’t follow that approach anymore? What would you do in answering the question? Remember that the professor is the boss in writing her exam. If she asks you to assume that under Nevada law the court orders the immediate execution in the public square of a defendant who objects to jurisdiction, you should answer the question on that assumption. I wouldn’t recommend answering on the basis of personal knowledge that Nevada actually uses a different rule. This isn’t the real world, it’s a constructed hypothetical and should be answered on its own terms. The real loser here is C. The Nevada court will, of course, apply its own rules concerning the procedure for raising jurisdictional objections in a Nevada law suit. And, the question indicates, its rule is that a defendant waives her objection to personal jurisdiction, even if she comes into court and raises it, if she also raises other arguments. That is just what Ito did here; he objected to jurisdiction, but then raised a defense on the merits as well. True, he raised the objection to personal jurisdiction first, but under (the assumed) Nevada law any response that appears to litigate the substantive issues in the case waives the special appearance and consents to the jurisdiction of the court. So A isn’t quite right; although Ito properly made a special appearance, his later motion raising the limitations issue waives his objection to jurisdiction. Ito should have waited to make his second motion until the personal jurisdiction issue was resolved. D is interesting. Might the court agree that Ito had made a procedural misstep, but still consider the jurisdictional issue, if it appears that the court lacks a basis for requiring Ito to defend in Nevada? Almost certainly not. The point of the special appearance rule is that an appearance that contests any issue other than jurisdiction is a consent to the court’s jurisdiction. Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel’s in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court’s jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court’s subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived. The very point of the special appearance rule is that the defendant waives it by combining it with other objections. Consequently, the court need not consider whether there is some other basis for exercising jurisdiction over Ito. B is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito’s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn’t. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do."

			"context": "The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person’s property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to tell the defendant that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called ‘‘personal service of process.’’ Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant’s home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as ‘‘constructive service,’’ as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson’s wise opinion in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property—the right to sue the bank for mismanagement—due process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in Mullane was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane held that ‘‘an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’’ 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of Mullane, several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in Mullane did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. The question below probes what it did require.",
			"question":"In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., the Supreme Court held that ",
			"options":"A. every person whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding. B. every person whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding.C. any person whose interests might be affected by the proceeding must be given notice by in-hand service of process. D. due to the large number of persons whose interests might be affected by the proceedings, notice by publication was sufficient on the facts of the case. E. None of the above is true.",
			"ground_truth":"A takes the position that everyone who might be affected by the settlement of the accounts must receive individual notice. If that were true, it would be impossible to settle the accounts of the trust. Even some beneficiaries with a current right to income may be impossible to find; if due process required individual notice to them it couldn’t be done. Other people have contingent interests: They might get income in the future, for example, as the heir of a current beneficiary. The bank may not know who these contingent beneficiaries are, though it might be able, with research, to find some of them. Justice Jackson viewed due process as a flexible concept that involves a balance of the importance of the right involved, the risk of an erroneous decision, the cost of providing individual notice, and the likelihood that the absentee’s interest would be protected by other parties. He rejected the view that everyone with some interest in the action must be individually notified for it to proceed. B would impose a lesser burden: to notify the persons whose interests could be ascertained with reasonable investigation. This could be done, but it would be costly, involving legal review of trusts and factual research on the whereabouts of all identified beneficiaries. This would more effectively reach affected persons, but the cost of doing so would likely impose such a severe burden on the plan as to ‘‘dissipate its advantages.’’ 339 U.S. at 318. Under the circumstances—including the presence of the guardian appointed to represent the interests of beneficiaries and the actual notice to many of them—the Court held that due process did not require that. Consequently, a beneficiary might never learn of the proceeding, have her right to object to the accounts foreclosed by it, and have no constitutional complaint. C is also a loser. Mullane held that notice by mail is sufficiently likely to actually inform a person of the proceeding to be constitutionally sufficient under most circumstances. In fact, Mullane did not hold that anyone had to be notified of the suit by personal service of process—that is, by in-hand delivery of the papers. And D fails as well. The Court required at least mail notice of the action to those beneficiaries whose names and addresses were known to the bank, since they could easily and inexpensively be informed of the action. So E is right. None of the prior statements is quite true"

			"context": "Venue in most federal actions is governed by 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), which provides: (b) Venue in general. A civil action may be brought in— (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. Note that subsections 1 and 2 are alternatives. Venue is proper in a district where either a defendant resides (if they are all residents of the state where the action is brought) or a district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. Section 1391(b)(3) is a ‘‘fallback’’ venue provision that is only available in unusual circumstances: when there is no district, anywhere in the United States, where venue would be proper under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). If the defendants all reside in the state where suit is brought, or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in some federal judicial district, or if property that is the subject of the action is found in a district, §1391(b)(3) cannot apply, because there will be at least one district in which venue is proper under §1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Note also that there is a nasty proviso in 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) that poses a trap for the unwary: The first sentence of that subsection provides that the venue options in §1391(b) apply ‘‘except as otherwise provided by law.’’ Section 1391 is a general venue statute that applies unless there is a special venue statute for the type of claim the plaintiff brings. The United States Code has many specialized venue provisions for particular types of actions. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1402 (tort action against the United States must be brought in the district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred). If there is a special venue statute for a particular type of claim, it may be interpreted as displacing the general venue choices in §1391(b)—that is, as providing alternative, exclusive venue choices for such claims—or as providing additional venue choices for those claims, along with those in §1391(b). See generally, Wright & Miller §3803. To sort out the basics of §1391(b), try the following question. Assume for all examples in the chapter that no special venue statute applies. In answering these questions, please do refer to the venue statutes. Once again, my questions are based on the assumption that you have the Federal Rules book available, so you can refer to relevant statutes and rules, rather than memorizing them. I want to test my students’ ability to apply provisions like the venue statutes or Federal Rules, rather than their memory of them. Needless to say, you should find out your professor’s policy on bringing materials into the exam before you prepare for it. If she doesn’t allow you to refer to the rules book, you obviously need to spend more time memorizing statutes and rules.",

His claim against Torruella is for fraud, his claim against Hopkins is for fraud and for violation of the Federal Truth in Lending Act. The negotiations between the parties for the financing took place in the Western District of Tennessee.

			"options":"A. the Western District of Kentucky. B. the Southern District of Indiana. C. the Southern District of Ohio. D. Both A and C are true",
			"ground_truth":"Let’s see. Under §1391(b)(1), venue is proper in a district where all defendants reside. But here they don’t all reside in the same district. Nor do they reside in different districts within the same state (in which case the district where either resides would be a proper venue). So §1391(b)(1) doesn’t provide any venue options for Dziezek. He’ll have to look to §1391(b)(2) or (b)(3). Section 1391(b)(2) is more fruitful. It allows venue in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim took place, or where property that is the subject of the action is located. Here, you might argue that the property in the Southern District of Ohio, where the subdivision is being built, is the subject of the action. This is doubtful, since the action is for fraud, not to establish an interest in the real estate. However, venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio anyway. Arguably, the partial construction of the subdivision in that district was a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim. But perhaps not; the claim really arises from the refusal of financing, not from the construction itself. A stronger argument—and I think it’s a winner—is that the omission to pay the contractor on the job took place in the Southern District of Ohio, so that is ‘‘a substantial part of the . . . omissions giving rise to the claim.’’ So C is a correct answer. But B is clearly not: the plaintiff’s residence is not one of the venue options in §1391(b). So the remaining question is whether the Western District of Kentucky, where Torruella resides, is a proper venue. Venue isn’t proper there under §1391(b)(1), which only applies if all defendants reside in districts within the same state. Here, only Torruella resides in Kentucky. Section 1391(b)(3) authorizes jurisdiction—in some cases—in ‘‘a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.’’ Here, Hopkins presumably is subject to personal jurisdiction in the Western District of Kentucky, since he resides there and could be served with process there. However, §1391(b) (3) is not available in this case. That section only applies if there is no other district where the case can be brought under subsection (1) or (2). Here, the Southern District of Ohio is proper. The Western District of Tennessee, where the parties negotiated the contract, would also be proper under §1391 (b)(2). Since Dziezek could choose either of those districts under subsection 2, and both defendants would be subject to jurisdiction there based on their involvement in the subdivision project, §1391(b)(3) never comes into play. Consequently, C is the right answer."

			"context": "The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789. They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. §1652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law would apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress’s intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as ‘‘the RDA’’) more narrowly in Swift. Justice Story concluded that the phrase, ‘‘the laws of the several states’’ in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that ‘‘The only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,’’ Swift recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state ‘‘law’’ in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct, Swift concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court—even in Pennsylvania—to follow that decision. If it didn’t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply the common law to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn’t think of it as ‘‘Pennsylvania common law,’’ or ‘‘Georgia common law,’’ but as the common law, which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue—such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser—and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the ‘‘true rule’’ of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities.1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in Swift that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the Swift case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, ‘‘What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,’’ but rather, ‘‘what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?’’ So, under Swift, federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat. Consider the following illustration of life under the Swift regime. Assume that pre-Erie law, that is, the Swift doctrine, applies.",
			"question":"Thomas is injured while walking along the railroad right of way in Pennsylvania in 1910, during the heyday of Swift v. Tyson. He is hit by something protruding from the train, perhaps a door. He sues the Erie Railroad Company in federal court for his injuries, basing federal jurisdiction on diversity. He alleges that the Railroad owed him a duty of due care, since it was aware that trespassers routinely used the right-of-way. Pennsylvania had no statute covering the duty of care owed to a railroad trespasser, but Pennsylvania cases had held that railroads owed trespassers only a duty to avoid willful or wanton conduct. Assume that no federal statute or constitutional provision applies",
			"options":"A. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story in Swift v. Tyson, would require the federal court to apply Pennsylvania law to Thomas’s claim. B. Under Swift v. Tyson, the federal court would apply Pennsylvania common law to Thomas’s claim, because its jurisdiction was based on diversity. C. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story, would require the federal judge to apply federal law to Thomas’s claim. D. None of the above is true.",
			"ground_truth":"Actually, none of the above is true, except D. Each mistakes the holding of Swift v. Tyson in one way or another. A fails because Justice Story held that the Rules of Decision Act did not require federal courts to apply common law rules of the state in which they sat. Instead, Swift held that the federal court should make its own judgment as to the proper common law rule, based on its review of all relevant cases and secondary authorities. It might conclude that the willful/wanton rule was appropriate, and choose to apply it, but it might also conclude that the Pennsylvania cases did not represent the correct approach to trespasser liability, and apply a different rule under Swift’s ‘‘general common law’’ approach. B also contains a fatal flaw. It states that Swift required the federal court in a diversity case to apply Pennsylvania common law in deciding Thomas’s case. Swift’s holding was quite the contrary: The point of Swift was that the federal judge in a diversity case (even a Pennsylvania federal judge) did not have to apply Pennsylvania common law—the decisions of the Pennsylvania state courts—in deciding the appropriate standard of care owed to Thomas. Under Swift, the federal judge was to apply the ‘‘general common law,’’ looking at relevant authorities from Pennsylvania, from other states, from English cases, and secondary authorities as well, in determining what the ‘‘true rule’’ of duty of care to a trespasser should be. Indeed, the mindset was, in a sense, that there was no such thing as ‘‘the common law of Pennsylvania,’’ but rather a general body of law called the common law, that judges from all state and federal courts attempted to perceive and apply correctly. C also misstates the holding of Swift. The RDA, even in the heyday of Swift, required federal courts to apply federal law where a federal statute or constitutional provision applied. Or, if a state statute or ‘‘local usage’’ applied, it should be applied in a diversity case. If there were no state statute or local usage involved, and no federal statute or constitutional provision at issue, the RDA did not dictate the governing law at all. Instead, Swift v. Tyson itself held that the federal court should apply ‘‘general common law,’’ based on its reading of all the authorities, not just the holdings of the local state courts. So, if one of the choices had been ‘‘Under Swift v. Tyson, the federal court would look to the general common law to determine the applicable duty of care,’’ that would have taken the prize."

			"ground_truth":"Rule 18(a) says that a party may join ‘‘as many claims as it has’’ against the opposing party. It doesn’t say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn’t say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says anything may be joined . . . so why shouldn’t you believe it? D is right. B is tempting, because so many of the joinder rules do limit the right to join claims to those arising from the same transaction or occurrence. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a); 13(g). It is also tempting because it would seem to make sense to allow Felina to litigate related claims together, but not to allow her to throw in the kitchen sink. But that’s just what the rule does. The rule-makers took the view that, as long as the parties are going to have a lawsuit, they might as well drag out any claims they have and resolve them all. Under the Federal Rules, the court can hear and determine both legal and equitable claims, and can grant almost any type of relief the plaintiff seeks. In addition, most cases aren’t tried, they are compromised through settlement, and the settlement is likely to be more effective if it encompasses all the claims the parties have against each other rather than just some. If the various claims do go to trial, the unrelated ones can be separated for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). So the rule-makers opted for the broadest possible scope of joinder of claims. They did not require that they arise from the same events, as both B and C suggest. They didn’t limit joinder to claims that seek the same type of relief, as A would. Whatever you’ve got, Felina, go for it. Would that all the rules were so clear. One caveat should be noted, however. Even if Rule 18(a) (or any other rule) authorizes joinder, the court must still have a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over each claim a party asserts. The fact that Rule 18(a) authorizes joinder should always be read as if it included the following phrase: ‘‘assuming that the court would have a basis for exercising jurisdiction over the added claims.’’ Often, such jurisdiction will be proper in federal court under 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute."

			"context": "The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, §2 and others that don’t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff’s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same ‘‘nucleus of operative fact.’’ In Tolman’s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, §2, as interpreted in Gibbs, to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court’s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a ‘‘federal hook’’—here, the FLSA claim—from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So Gibbs recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman’s contract claim. But in Kroger, the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can’t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in Gibbs. Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that Gibbs provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise ‘‘supplemental jurisdiction’’ over related claims in proper federal cases. Here’s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a). Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has ‘‘original jurisdiction,’’ because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the ‘‘same case or controversy.’’ And, the legislative history of §1367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the Gibbs ‘‘common nucleus of operative fact’’ test are part of the same ‘‘case or controversy.’’ So, as long as the court has a federal ‘‘hook’’—a claim properly within the federal court’s original jurisdiction—it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There’s more to §1367, but for now let’s focus on this basic purpose of §1367(a).",
			"question":"Garabedian, an Arkansas developer, sues Ellis, a local Arkansas official, under 42 U.S.C. §1983, for deprivation of his First Amendment rights, for refusing to allow him to speak at a local zoning meeting concerning a proposal by a competitor. He adds a second claim against Ellis for defamation, a state tort claim, based on statements Ellis made to the local newspaper about the quality of the construction on several houses Garabedian had built in town. The federal court",
			"options":"A. has constitutional authority to hear Garabedian’s defamation claim under Gibbs, but does not have statutory authority to do so under §1367(a). B. has statutory authority to hear Garabedian’s defamation claim under §1367(a), but it would be unconstitutional, under Gibbs, for the court to do so. C. has both constitutional and statutory authority to hear Garabedian’s defamation claim. D. has neither constitutional nor statutory authority to hear Garabedian’s defamation claim.",
			"ground_truth":"This is pretty straightforward, but there’s no harm in building a little self-confidence as we wade into a difficult subject. Here, the §1983 claim arises under federal law. The federal court has ‘‘original jurisdiction’’ over it. That is, it is a claim that, on its own, may be brought in federal court under arising-under jurisdiction. So it provides that necessary federal hook from which to hang related state law claims. Since there is a proper federal claim, Gibbs holds that it is constitutionally permissible to hear jurisdictionally insufficient claims (like Garabedian’s defamation claim) if they arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the proper federal claim. And, in §1367(a), Congress authorized federal courts, where there is a claim within the federal court’s ‘‘original jurisdiction,’’ to hear other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims if they are part of the ‘‘same case or controversy.’’ These two tests basically require the same thing: that the state law claim arise out of the same underlying dispute as the federal claim. The cases indicate that Congress, in using the phrase ‘‘same case or controversy’’ in §1367(a), meant to give supplemental jurisdiction to the full reach that Gibbs held constitutionally permissible under the ‘‘nucleus of operative fact’’ test. So, since the constitutional test under Gibbs and the statutory test under §1367(a) are the same, both A and B have to be wrong. If the defamation claim satisfies the Gibbs test, it satisfies the statute; if it doesn’t satisfy Gibbs, it doesn’t satisfy the statute. The question primarily tests whether you’ve got that basic point down. If you do, it only remains to decide whether the defamation claim arises from the same set of facts as the First Amendment claim. C is wrong, because it pretty clearly doesn’t. Even if Garabedian and Ellis have a long-running local feud going, and both claims arise from the bad blood between the parties, these appear to be separate incidents that took place at different times and involve different issues. Thus, Gibbs would not support sweeping in the jurisdictionally insufficient claim, just because Garabedian can sue on the First Amendment claim in federal court. There has to be a limit on this inferential extension of federal jurisdiction to claims not expressly authorized in Article III, §2. The limit is the scope of a single dispute, and this one looks like two distinct disputes, though perhaps linked by ongoing animosity. So D is the best choice here."

			"context": "The plaintiff starts the ball rolling by filing a complaint, but what has to be in it? Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court’s jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) ‘‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is notice to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This ‘‘short and plain statement’’ requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff’s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant’s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.",
			"question":"Carstairs is injured when he is hit by Noble’s car. He sues Noble in federal court, alleging that the court has jurisdiction on the basis of diversity, that ‘‘the defendant hit me while driving down Main Street on June 14, 2016,’’ and that he suffered physical injuries as a result. He demands $100,000 in damages. Which of the following is the best argument that the complaint is insufficient under Rule 8(a)(2)?",

The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. D. The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not suggest that Noble has violated a legal right that gives Carstairs a right to relief from him.",
			"ground_truth":"Carstairs’s complaint here is darned minimal . . . but with just a little work it would probably survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. We can eliminate two of the choices easily. Both A and B take the position that more detail about the facts is needed. The court is unlikely to agree. The complaint provides the date and the place of the accident (and, or course, the name of the victim, since the plaintiff’s name is in the caption of the complaint—see Rule 10(a)). This is probably enough to give Noble notice of the events he is being sued for. After all, how many accidents did he have with Carstairs on Main Street on June 14? Noble has enough information about the source of Carstairs’s claim that he can begin to investigate it and form a defense. He can get the additional detail he needs through discovery. C takes the position that Carstairs’s complaint is insufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) because it does not expressly allege that Noble owed him a duty of care. In a simple case, it is probably sufficient to allege the claim generally, or perhaps even to allege facts that show that the plaintiff may be able to prove those elements. The plaintiff will of course have to prove every element in order to recover, but it is unlikely that the judge would require Carstairs to amend to add an allegation that Noble owed him a duty of care. If, in a complex case, the plaintiff has not alleged an element, and the defendant doubts that the plaintiff has grounds to plead it under the constraints of Rule 11, he will likely challenge the plaintiff’s complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In this situation, the motion challenges whether the plaintiff can allege each element necessary to establish her claims, and may lead the judge to require the plaintiff to amend to include the disputed allegation. See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598 (1998) (authorizing trial judges to require specific allegations where plaintiff’s ability to make them is challenged). In a straightforward negligence case, however, it is very doubtful that a judge would deem the complaint insufficient for failure to expressly allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. However, though the complaint may be very spare, it ought to provide an indication that ‘‘the pleader is entitled to relief.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A plaintiff cannot recover from a driver simply because the driver hit him on Main Street. Something more is needed to show that Carstairs is entitled to damages from Noble: a violation of the plaintiff’s legal rights. This complaint doesn’t allege that Noble did anything wrong, simply that he hit him. Contrary to public belief, an accident victim isn’t entitled to damages just because he was hurt; he must prove that the driver was at fault. The word ‘‘negligently’’ after ‘‘driving’’ would put the court and Noble on notice that Carstairs alleges that the accident resulted from Noble’s fault, which would show an entitlement to relief. Absent some suggestion of carelessness by Noble, the complaint arguably doesn’t ‘‘state a claim upon which relief can be granted.’’ On the other hand, the logic of Rule 8(a)(2) is to provide an informal description of the claim, not a mechanical black letter pronouncement of every element required in order to recover. It seems that a judge, who is supposed to take all inferences in the pleader’s favor in determining whether he has stated a claim, could reasonably infer that Carstairs alleges that Noble was driving negligently. After all, he has sued him for damages. Well, maybe so, but I think the better view is that the complaint should contain some indication that the claim alleged entitles the pleader to relief, and that means that the complaint should suggest a legal right of the plaintiff that the defendant has violated. On this reasoning, D represents the best argument that the complaint is insufficient. Some judges would likely so rule; others would probably let it go forward."

			"context": "The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).) Rule 11 (from https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11) : (a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or party's attention. (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.",

A lawyer files a complaint seeking damages for medical expenses her client claims to have suffered, without seeking any evidence from the client that she incurred those expenses.",
			"ground_truth":"Rule 11 does not apply to all acts in the course of litigation, or even to most. It applies only to representations made before the court. The first sentence of Rule 11(b) makes that clear: The certifications under the Rule apply when a lawyer or unrepresented party ‘‘present[s] to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating’’ that submission. In the question, only D involves such a filing. By filing the complaint, Middleton ‘‘presented to the court’’ the demand for medical expenses. That act of filing the pleading triggers the representations in Rule 11(b) about positions taken in that pleading. If the claim for medical expenses is unsupported, and Middleton did not take adequate steps to determine whether there is support for it, she can be sanctioned for submitting it to the court."

			"context": "When a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court, the defendant must file a response to it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) describes her options. The rule provides, in the first sentence, that the defendant should put every defense that she has to a claim in her answer to the complaint. However, if the defendant has certain objections to the case, she may raise them by a ‘‘pre-answer motion’’ before pleading, that is, before answering the complaint. If the defendant makes a pre-answer motion, it suspends the time for answering the complaint until the court addresses the objections raised in the motion. See Rule 12(a)(4)(A), (B). Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1 . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2 . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3 . improper venue; 4 . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5 . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6 . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7 . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff’s claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint. A crucial point about Rule 12 pre-answer motions is that the defendant never has to make one. Making a pre-answer motion to assert these defenses is allowed, but not required. If the defendant prefers, she may raise any of these seven objections—or all of them—in her answer instead. I always snare a reasonable percentage of students on this basic point.

			"context": "A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.’’ In an effort to rein in discovery, the ‘‘relevant to the claim or defense of any party’’ language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the pending action,’’ but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ‘‘proportionality factors’’ in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ‘‘relevant to a claim or defense in the action’’ standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff’s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants’ arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn’t admissible as evidence at a trial. ‘‘Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.’’ For example, statements that are ‘‘hearsay,’’ that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here’s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).",

Karim’s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such ‘‘subsequent remedial measures’’ is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff’s injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before.

D. is within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).",
			"ground_truth":"A is pretty much a throwaway. Rule 26(b)(1) explicitly provides that information is discoverable, even if it could not be admitted into evidence at trial, if it meets the broad relevance standard in the rule. The idea is that information might assist a party in developing her case, even though it could not be presented at trial. This is manifestly true in many cases. For example, the hearsay statement ‘‘I heard Smith say that a Federal Express delivery man drove away after the accident’’ might be inadmissible hearsay. But this information could clearly assist the plaintiff in finding an important witness. Similarly, in an assault case, evidence that a witness had heard of instances of violence by the defendant would likely be inadmissible hearsay, yet could lead to the discovery of evidence of violent conduct that could be used to impeach the defendant’s testimony about who started a fight. B rests on the assumption that events taking place after a claim arises are irrelevant to the issues in a law suit. However, such evidence frequently leads to admissible evidence relevant to the plaintiff’s claim. For example, in the assault case, evidence of later assaults by a defendant would be relevant to impeach him if he testifies that the plaintiff started the quarrel. Similarly, evidence that a company consistently promoted men over women—before and after the plaintiff was passed over—would assist a sex discrimination plaintiff to show a pattern of discriminatory conduct. Here, evidence that the company made its stamping machine safer after the accident is certainly relevant to the case. It suggests that the machine can be made safer, which may mean that they were aware of that before Karim’s accident but decided, for whatever reason, not to improve it. If Karim’s counsel discovers that they have added a guard, she can take depositions of Precision’s engineers, to determine when they developed the design for the guard, and why it was not added before. This could lead to evidence suggesting that Precision was negligent, because it was aware of the need for the guard but delayed introducing it. Surely, this information is not only ‘‘relevant to the subject matter in the action’’ (the Rule 26(b)(1) standard before the 2000 amendment), but also ‘‘relevant to the claim’’ of a party (the current standard in Rule 26(b)(1)). It is relevant to Karim’s claim that Precision negligently failed to act with reasonable care in designing the stamping machine. Thus, C fails; D is the best answer."

Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose • the identity of individuals ‘‘likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses’’ • copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information) and things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses • a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based • any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f). Until this meeting takes place, the parties are barred from taking discovery by other means (such as interrogatories, requests for documents, or depositions). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness’s testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness’s testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party ‘‘may use to support its claims or defenses.’’ Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal supporting evidence, but not adverse evidence. This avoids placing counsel in the position of having to review all known evidence, locate all documents that might support the other party’s case, and hand them over without a request.",
			"question":"Fremont Publishing Company sues New Era Press for publishing a story about a shipwreck that it claims duplicated a copyrighted story from one of its books. New Era denies that Fremont held the copyright to the story. Shortly after the parties make their disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1), New Era’s lawyers learn that Fremont had received a letter a year earlier from an individual claiming that he held the copyright on the shipwreck story and demanding compensation from Fremont for using it. Fremont had not disclosed the existence of this letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures.",
			"options":"A. should move for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1) for Fremont’s failure to disclose the letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures. B. should move to require supplemental disclosure of the letter, under Rules 26(a)(1) and 26(e)(1). C. should send Fremont a Rule 34 Request for Production of documents to obtain the letter. D. cannot obtain the letter, because it is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a).",
			"ground_truth":"In this example, Fremont evidently had the document but failed to include it in its initial disclosure. New Era learns that it exists and was left out. What should it do? B seems like a sensible course, to move for further disclosure, since the letter was not produced. This isn’t likely to be granted, however, because the letter probably does not have to be disclosed. Rule 26(a)(1) (A)(ii) requires disclosure of documents the disclosing party ‘‘may use to support its claims or defenses.’’ It hardly seems that Fremont will use this letter, challenging the validity of its copyright, to support its claim against New Era for infringing that copyright. If the letter was not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii), the court is not going to order it disclosed in response to New Era’s motion. For the same reason, the motion for sanctions suggested in A isn’t going to be granted: Fremont would not be sanctioned for failure to disclose the letter if it was not required to disclose it. D suggests that New Era cannot obtain the letter, since it is not within the scope of disclosure under Rule 26(a). While the letter very probably is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a), that does not mean that New Era cannot obtain it through discovery. It only means that Fremont does not have to disclose it automatically at the outset of the case. It is still discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1), which allows parties to obtain discovery of information ‘‘relevant to the claim or defense of any party’’ in the action. Surely, the letter is relevant to New Era’s defense that Fremont did not have a copyright on the story. Consequently, it is subject to discovery under the broad standard of relevance in Rule 26(b)(1). So C is the best answer: New Era is entitled to obtain this letter through the traditional discovery devices and may send Fremont a request for production of the letter under Rule 34. This illustrates that a party cannot rely on disclosure as a substitute for discovery. Disclosure will only reveal information favorable to the other party (that it may ‘‘use to support its claims or defenses’’). To obtain information that is unfavorable to Fremont, New Era must ask for it using the traditional discovery devices."

			"context":"Cases analyzing domicile for purposes of diversity frequently cite evidence about the person’s practical affairs, in order to establish a party’s intent. The court may rely on facts such as where the party votes, has health insurance, has a driver’s license, rents an apartment, has a bank account, registers her car, and so forth. Certainly, such facts are relevant evidence of a person’s intent to remain in a state, or not to. But keep in mind that the  test itself  is the person’s intent. Evidence about her practical affairs may help to demonstrate her subjective intent, but a person is not automatically domiciled where she has an apartment, or votes, or maintains her health insurance. If she were,  that would be the test,  rather than her subjective intent. Parties introduce such practical evidence about a person’s conduct to prove the ultimately relevant fact: her intent. But a person could be domiciled in Wisconsin, even though most of these practical factors point to Illinois. It’s all a matter of trying to ascertain a subjective fact based on all the evidence. A court will certainly look at the party’s testimony in assessing intent, but will also consider whether her practical conduct corroborates or refutes that testimony.",
			"question":"Rossi grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. In August 2017, she departed for college in Idaho. After starting school in Idaho, she registered her car there and established a bank account there. She gets health coverage through college. She has an apartment there, which she has taken on a one-year lease. She has a part-time job in Idaho, and has Idaho state taxes taken out of her check. On her application for the job she listed her Idaho address and telephone number. Her plan is to complete a two-year computer technician degree, and then return to Pennsylvania, where her fiancee has just taken over his family’s construction business in Erie. (They have reserved a hall for their wedding in June 2019.) However, she may need a bit more than two years to finish the degree, if tuition goes up too much. Three months after arriving in Idaho, Rossi brings suit against a Pennsylvania surgeon, for an injury suffered in an operation performed in Pennsylvania a year before. She sues in federal court on the basis of diversity. The court will probably conclude that Rossi is domiciled in",
			"options":"A.  Pennsylvania, since she is only in Idaho as a student.B.  Pennsylvania, since she intends to return to Pennsylvania when she finishes her degree.C.  Idaho, since she has an apartment there, goes to school there, has a job there, has health coverage there and pays Idaho state taxes on her income.D.  Idaho, since she doesn’t know when she will finish the college program.E.  Idaho, if she testifies in her deposition that she plans to remain there indefinitely.",
			"ground_truth":"Let’s start with  C , which suggests that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho because she has an apartment there, an Idaho job, health insurance there, and so on. The example illustrates a situation in which most of these practical facts suggest that one state is the domicile, but it probably isn’t. Here, there are good reasons for Rossi to arrange her practical affairs as she has, even if she plans to leave Idaho. If you went to school in a state, wouldn’t you need a place to live? Wouldn’t you get a job if you needed money? Wouldn’t you give your local address so the employer could get in touch with you? Wouldn’t you join the college health plan? Very likely, you would do all of these things, whether you intended to leave the state when you finished the degree or not. In this case, there’s a perfectly good explanation for all these practical choices, even if Rossi has definite plans to leave the state. So, these facts do not themselves establish that Rossi has an open-ended commitment to living in Idaho. So  C  is wrong. D  suggests that Rossi is domiciled in Idaho, because she doesn’t know exactly when she will finish her degree. However, while Rossi doesn’t know when she will finish, she does have definite plans to leave Idaho when she does. Since she plans to leave upon the occurrence of a particular event, her stay is not open-ended. She’s an Idaho visitor, not a domiciliary, under domicile analysis. But  A  isn’t right either. It implies that you can never establish a domicile by going to a state as a student. That isn’t so. If you go to a state to attend school, without definite plans beyond your studies, you can establish a domicile there. Many students do satisfy the reside-with- intent-to-remain-indefinitely test by going to school. A case in point, on which this example is very loosely based, is  Gordon v. Steele,  376 F. Supp. 575 (W.D. Pa. 1974). How about  E , which takes the position that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho if she testifies that she plans to remain there indefinitely? Would this be dispositive? Surely not. People do sometimes lie. More often, some motive, such as access to federal court, may color their view of a subjective fact. In determining Rossi’s domicile, the court would look at all the evidence, not just her testimony. Here, the facts pointing to Idaho are easily explained on another basis. And the fact that her fiancee has taken over the family business and they plan to marry at the time she will likely complete her studies very strongly suggests that she intends to return. Her testimony is important evidence about her intent, but not solely dispositive. So  B  is the best answer. Rossi has not established a domicile in Idaho, because she went there with clear plans to leave when she finished her degree. The question tells you that she plans to leave, and her engagement clearly corroborates her intent to go back to Erie. So the point is that the practical factors may be useful in evaluating a person’s subjective intent. But the ultimate fact to be proved, under the domicile test, is the intent itself."

			"context": "Remember that  Mottley is frequently referred to as the ‘‘well-pleaded complaint’’ rule, because it requires the court to consider not what the plaintiff has pleaded, but what she needed to plead  to state her cause of action. Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad’s anticipated defense) doesn’t mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it’s hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it’s fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn’t claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is ‘‘We made a contract with the railroad, it didn’t perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.’’ That is the substance of the Mottleys’ position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad’s reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn’t  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn’t make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could ‘‘make a federal case’’ out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts’ jurisdiction.",
			"question":"Olefsky, from Florida, is diagnosed with leukemia. Testing of his well determines that it is polluted with toxic chemicals, which may have caused his disease. Officials investigate and determine that the chemicals had migrated through the ground-water from a nearby landfill run by Acme Disposal Corporation, a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Florida. The landfill is completely lined, to prevent leaching into the groundwater, but several years ago one of Acme’s drivers had dumped a load outside the lined area. The investigation also revealed other problems with Acme’s waste management practices. For example, Acme had violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests with the Environmental Protection Agency detailing the contents of shipments of hazardous wastes, as required by the Act. Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries. The complaint also alleges that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests (though it does not allege damages arising from those violations). Acme moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.",
			"options":"A.  The motion will be denied if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act.B.  The motion will be denied, because Olefsky has alleged a violation of federal law in his complaint.C.  The motion will be granted, even if the case arises under federal law, because Acme’s principal place of business is in Florida, so that the parties are not diverse.D.  The motion will be granted, since Olefsky’s case does not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law, as that phrase is interpreted in 28 U.S.C. §1331.",
			"ground_truth":"Sometimes the most basic points about a subject are the most confusing. It’s very important to recognize what is wrong with the third choice here.  C  suggests that there must be both diversity  and  a federal question in order to sue in federal court. Not so; a plaintiff may sue in federal court as long as her case satisfies  one category  of federal jurisdiction . . . it doesn’t have to fit into two, or ten! Thus, if this case arises under federal law, it can be brought in federal court, even though the parties are both from Florida. Conversely, if they were diverse, the case could be brought in federal court even if it arose under state law. Does Olefsky’s case arise under federal law?  A  suggests that it does if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. However, even if Acme violated the Act, that doesn’t mean that Olefsky’s case arises under it. His claim for damages does not arise from the failure to file EPA reports; it arises from dumping by Acme’s driver in an unlined area. So what if they violated the federal reporting statute? How does that strengthen Olefsky’s case? He’s suing for nuisance, a state tort theory based on different acts by the defendant. It’s irrelevant to Olefsky’s case that they violated other federal pollution requirements. Suppose Acme had violated a federal accounting statute, and Olefsky found that out. Could he sue for his pollution claim and argue that it arises under federal law because they violated a federal law irrelevant to his claim? Certainly not. Olefsky may have alleged a federal violation in his complaint, but it doesn’t  have to be in there  to state his claim against Acme. His ‘‘well-pleaded complaint’’—one that contains the allegations that entitle him to sue Acme for damages, but  only  those allegations— would contain nuisance allegations, but nothing about the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. Indeed, Olefsky’s right to recover would be exactly the same if there were no Federal Toxics Transportation Act. If that is true, the statute is obviously irrelevant to his claim, and throwing promiscuous references to it into the complaint will not make the case ‘‘arise under’’ federal law. Thus,  A  is wrong, and that means that  B  is too. If it’s irrelevant that Acme violated the statute, it’s also irrelevant that Olefsky alleged that they did.  D  takes the prize. This case asserts a state tort claim and therefore does not arise under federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1331."

			"context": "Chief Justice Marshall’s Strawbridge  Rule: The requirement of complete diversity Very early on, the Supreme Court held that diversity jurisdiction is only proper if all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants. Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will ‘‘destroy diversity.’’ (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the non diverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff’s state, to ‘‘perfect diversity.’’) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state ‘‘citizens,’’ but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can’t have ‘‘intent’’ the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the ‘‘state citizenship’’ of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.",

Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices B and C.",
			"ground_truth":"Questions with double choices, like  D  here, can be excruciating. You review the answers and find one that is ‘‘right.’’ You think you’re all set, and then realize that you aren’t, since two may be right. Back to the drawing board. One lesson, of course, is to read all the choices very carefully. A  is a proper diversity case (and therefore not the right answer) since no defendant is from the same state as any plaintiff.  C  is not a proper diversity case, since Adams Corporation is from the same state as Madison: Its principal place of business is in Virginia. Adams can’t argue that there’s diversity because it is from Delaware, where it is incorporated. The point of 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) is that the corporation is considered a citizen of  both  states, and is not diverse from a citizen of either. So we have one right answer. The tougher question is whether there is diversity jurisdiction in  B , in which Washington Corporation is not incorporated in Madison’s state, and does not have its principal place of business there, but does have a substantial place of business there. The statute provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state of ‘‘the’’ principal place of business, suggesting that only one will be chosen, even if the corporation has large establishments in several. That has been the holding of the courts. A corporation—say, McDonalds, of hamburger fame—may have many restaurants and a great deal of business in lots of states, but under §1332(c)(1) the court must choose one as its ‘‘principal’’ place of business. The question tells you that Washington Corporation’s principal place of business is Maryland. It can’t be diverse from a Marylander, but is diverse from Virginians. So  B is a good diversity case; the right answer is  C . By the way, this question suggests two useful hints about taking multiple-choice questions. • First, read the question with excruciating care. Here, it would be easy to read the question as ‘‘In which cases would the court  have jurisdiction?’’ If you do, of course, you will get it wrong. In a lecture by an expert on the multistate bar exam (which consists solely of multiple-choice questions) the speaker described the multistate exam as ‘‘an exercise in reading comprehension.’’ I would be willing to wager that most students get more questions wrong by failing to read carefully than they do from lack of substantive knowledge. • Second, when a question tells you something is true, take it on faith. Here, for example, don’t go questioning whether Washington Corporation’s large office in Virginia might be its principal place of business. Your professor is the boss in the artificial world of the exam. If she says its principal place of business is Maryland, answer the question based on that premise, whether you believe it or not."

			"context": "Congress has provided that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state of its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). So, to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule to corporate parties to a diversity case, courts have to determine where a corporation’s principal place of business is. Corporations conduct their business in many different ways. Most corporations are small, and are incorporated in one state and do all their business in that state. These corporations are citizens of only one state. But large corporations might have extensive activities in many states—think Home Depot, or McDonalds. And some corporations will incorporate in one state, concentrate their manufacturing activities in another, and maintain their headquarters, where the corporation’s high-level decisions are made, in a third. Until 2010, federal courts took several approaches to determining a corporation’s principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). Some held that the state of a corporation’s headquarters is the state of its principal place of business, even if the corporation’s manufacturing or service activities took place elsewhere. Other courts, however, applied a ‘‘daily activities’’ test if a corporation’s productive activities were primarily concentrated in a single state, reasoning that the corporation will be perceived as ‘‘local’’ in that state, since it will have the most contact with the public there. If the productive activities were widely spread among states, these courts would look to the state where the corporation has its headquarters or ‘‘nerve center,’’ since the diffused activities would all be coordinated from that state. All of this is now interesting history, because in 2010 the Supreme Court held, in  Hertz Corp. v. Friend,  559 U.S. 77 (2010), that the corporation’s principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters in all cases. After  Hertz , a corporation is citizen of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties.",

C.  is not complete diversity because both plaintiffs are from Texas. D.  is not complete diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex. Under 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) Texas is Apex’s principal place of business, because Texas citizens in El Paso will think of Apex as ‘‘local,’’ while hardly anyone in Oklahoma will know anything about Apex Corporation, which has very low visibility in Oklahoma. E.  is diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex, because Apex is a citizen of Delaware based on its incorporation there.",
			"ground_truth":"The wrong answers in a multiple choice question are called ‘‘distractors.’’ Beguiling choices like  B  suggest the reason. There is something so  plausible  about it, isn’t there? The suit is brought in the state where the plaintiffs live, so no diversity? Of course this doesn’t make sense, but it threatens to distract you from the business at hand. To determine diversity, we compare the state citizenship of the plaintiffs and the defendants, not the plaintiffs’ citizenship and the place where the suit is brought. If the parties are from different states, it does not matter that one of the parties is a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought. The case is a proper diversity case,  no matter what state the suit is brought in. C  should not fool any but the truly unprepared. Under  Strawbridge v. Curtiss , you can have a hundred plaintiffs from the same state, as long as no defendant is from that state. So the fact that both plaintiffs are from Texas does not defeat diversity jurisdiction. And you should have rejected  E  quickly as well. A corporation is a citizen of  both  its state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business, so we need to determine that here in order to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. D  is beguiling, because it would make a lot of sense for a court to treat Apex as local in the state where its daily productive activity is centered. Many courts did apply this approach before the Supreme Court decided  Hertz Corp. v. Friend . But that case is a Supreme Court case; its decisions are the supreme law of the land, and in  Hertz  the Court held that a corporation’s principal place of business for diversity purposes is in the state where it has its central offices—its headquarters from which it directs corporate operations. Here, that state is Oklahoma, so Apex is a citizen of Oklahoma and of Delaware, and there is complete diversity between it and the Texas plaintiffs.  A  takes the prize."

			"context": "Diversity in cases involving foreign citizens Article III, §2 provides that federal courts may hear not only claims between citizens of different states, but also claims between citizens of a state and ‘‘foreign . . . Citizens or Subjects’’ (sometimes called ‘‘aliens’’). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, §2. And, 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff’s state, is a foreign national (an alien). For diversity purposes, a person can’t be a ‘‘citizen’’ of a state unless she is also a citizen of the United States. Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc’s case if he has been ‘‘admitted for permanent residence in the United States.’’ Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as ‘‘local’’ in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a ‘‘green card’’), Frankel could sue him in federal court under §1332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn’t domiciled in one. However, he isn’t an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn’t apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie ‘‘Cleopatra.’’ Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living—indefinitely—in England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn’t an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain",

The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Assume that Toussaint has not been admitted to the United States for ‘‘permanent residence.’’) ",
			"options":"A.  There is no jurisdiction over the action because Toussaint is a citizen of Iowa. B.

There is no jurisdiction over the claims against Toussaint, because she is an alien domiciled in Iowa. D.  There is jurisdiction over the entire action.",
			"ground_truth":"This question should help to sort out the complexities of applying diversity to cases involving American citizens and aliens. The crux of the problem is the point made above: To be a ‘‘citizen’’ for diversity purposes, you must be  both  a citizen of the United States and domiciled in a state. Here, Toussaint, while domiciled in Iowa, is not a citizen of Iowa, because she isn’t an American citizen. She’s a French national, and therefore, under Article III, §2, she is an alien (‘‘a citizen or subject of a foreign country’’). (The exception in §1332(a)(2) does not apply, because Toussaint has not been admitted for permanent residence.) So  A  is wrong. C  is wrong, too. Article III authorizes suits between citizens of a state (or, as here, of several states) and aliens. It is irrelevant that Toussaint is domiciled in Iowa; she remains a Frenchwoman until she becomes an American citizen (or is admitted for permanent residence, under §1332(a)(2)). And  D  is wrong, because Gompers is not a citizen of any state. Remember that, to be a citizen of a state you must be both an American citizen and domiciled in a state. Gompers is an American citizen, but he isn’t domiciled in any state, since he is living in Great Britain with the intent to remain there indefinitely. The claim against him would have to be dropped for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, go with B."

			"context": "The relation between statutory diversity jurisdiction and the constitutional grant Article III, §2 of the Constitution creates diversity jurisdiction in very general terms. It does not expressly state whether there must be ‘‘complete diversity,’’ or whether diversity might be satisfied if  some plaintiffs are diverse from  some  defendants.  Strawbridge v. Curtiss,  of course, held that all defendants must be diverse from all plaintiffs, but for many years it was unclear whether  Strawbridge  interpreted Article III or interpreted the statute by which Congress conveys diversity jurisdiction to the lower federal courts. If  Strawbridge  interpreted the language ‘‘citizens of different states’’ in Article III, the complete diversity rule would be constitutionally required, and could not be changed . . . unless the Court overruled  Strawbridge  or the Constitution were amended. In  State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire,  386 U.S. 523 (1967), the Supreme Court held that  Strawbridge  interpreted the diversity statute, not Article III. It further held that, for Article III purposes, a case is ‘‘between citizens of different states’’ so long as at least one plaintiff is diverse from one defendant. Consequently, it is now clear that diversity jurisdiction exists under Article III as long as there is ‘‘minimal diversity,’’ that is, as long as some plaintiff is diverse from some defendant. However,  Strawbridge,  which interprets the diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. §1332(a), to require complete diversity, has never been overruled. 1  Nor has Congress amended §1332(a) to allow diversity jurisdiction based on minimal diversity. But it  could be  changed by Congress. Recall that the jurisdiction allowed under the Constitution is not self-executing. The lower federal courts derive their jurisdiction from Congress.

			"ground_truth":"It’s crucial to understand why  D  is wrong. Article III of the Constitution doesn’t create federal district courts, and doesn’t directly bestow any jurisdiction on them. Section 1 of Article III authorizes Congress  to create lower federal courts if it chooses to. This power to create lower federal courts (or not to) carries with it the implied authority to create them, but to authorize them to hear only some of the cases listed in Article III, §2. See  Kline v. Burke Constr. Inc.,  260 U.S. 226, 233-234 (1922). In other words, Article III, §2 defines the universe of cases that federal courts may potentially hear, but Congress creates the lower federal courts and can give them as much or as little of the Article III jurisdiction as it chooses to. It need not—and never has—bestowed all of the constitutionally permissible jurisdiction on the lower federal courts. So  D  is wrong because Article III does not directly grant jurisdiction to the federal district courts; Congress does.  A  is wrong too, because Congress cannot give the lower federal courts any jurisdiction it wants. It may only grant jurisdiction over cases within the categories listed in Article III, §2, which defines the outer limits of the federal judicial power. And  B  is also wrong, because  Strawbridge,  we now know (from the  Tashire  decision), interpreted the federal diversity statute, not Article III, §2. Since it is the statute, §1332(a) (as interpreted by  Strawbridge ), that requires complete diversity, Congress could change it. Ironically, of course, it was really Chief Justice Marshall who established the complete diversity requirement, in  Strawbridge.  But he interpreted the diversity statute to require complete diversity, not the Constitution, and the statute may be changed by Congress. So don’t blame Marshall alone for the rule; Congress hasn’t changed it in two hundred years. Thus,  C  is right. Smith’s bill would authorize jurisdiction based on ‘‘minimal diversity.’’ Tashire  holds that ‘‘minimal diversity’’ cases are proper diversity cases, within the meaning of Article III, §2, so Congress could authorize federal district courts to hear them."

Curtiss,  of course, held that all defendants must be diverse from all plaintiffs, but for many years it was unclear whether  Strawbridge  interpreted Article III or interpreted the statute by which Congress conveys diversity jurisdiction to the lower federal courts.

The  Strawbridge  rule illustrates one situation in which the statutory grant is narrower than the constitutional authority. Another example is the amount-in-controversy requirement. Article III, §2 contains no monetary restriction on diversity jurisdiction; it broadly authorizes jurisdiction over all cases between citizens of different states. Congress’s grant of diversity jurisdiction to the federal district courts, however, includes an amount-in-controversy requirement, in order to keep small diversity cases out of federal court. See 28 U.S.C. §1332(a) (granting jurisdiction over diversity cases in which ‘‘the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest or costs’’).

Analytical questions call for a higher order of reasoning than this amount-in-controversy hypo. Most professors will test your analytical skills, since they are trying to teach you to think, not memorize. So I think you will find the more analytical examples in this book more representative of law school exams—either multiple-choice or essay exams.

			"context": "One problem with requiring a minimum amount in controversy is that you have to know how much is ‘‘in controversy’’ in order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction. Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the ‘‘ St. Paul Mercury  rule,’’ the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff’s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff’s injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is ‘‘to a legal certainty’’ worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court. It is only where her injuries or losses could not rationally support a verdict for the jurisdictional amount that her claim will be dismissed. Here’s a question that probes the application of the  St. Paul Mercury rule.",
			"question": "Wanda brings a diversity action against Peroski in federal court for injuries suffered in a construction accident. As a result of the accident, Wanda suffered a badly sprained ankle. She alleges that Peroski’s negligence caused the accident. However, Peroski denies that her conduct was negligent. Wanda demands $100,000 in damages for her injuries.",
			"options":"A.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent. B.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges. C.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda’s damages exceed $75,000. D.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met, because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages.",
			"ground_truth":"If D were the right answer to this question, the amount-in- controversy requirement would be a dead letter. Plaintiffs would simply demand large damages in their complaints, and the federal court would have to hear their cases. Surely, federal judges are too savvy to leave it at that. The court won’t simply accept the number Wanda’s lawyer asks for in damages; it will look at  the actual injury Wanda has suffered,  and consider whether those injuries could rationally support a verdict over the required amount. The rule suggested by  C  also misperceives the meaning of the  St. Paul Mercury  test. It suggests that the amount requirement is only satisfied where the plaintiff will definitely recover more than $75,000. Under this test, if the plaintiff might recover more, but also might recover less, there would be no diversity jurisdiction. Under  St. Paul Mercury,  the presumption is the opposite: if the damages are in the debatable range, where a reasonable jury might award more, or might award less, the amount requirement is met. Only where it is clear, as a matter of law, that the award will be  less  is the amount requirement not met. A  can’t be right either: The amount-in-controversy question is not whether the plaintiff is likely to win her case on the merits, but whether, if  she does,  she might recover more than $75,000. After all, §1332(a) requires that more than $75,000 must be ‘‘in controversy,’’ not actually recovered. If the court had to consider the strength of the plaintiff’s proof of her claim in order to decide whether the amount-in-controversy requirement was met, it would not be able to decide this preliminary issue without developing the facts through discovery and litigating the merits of the case. That would be a poor rule indeed for a question of jurisdiction, which should be settled at the outset of the case. So  B  is the best answer. The court will look at Wanda’s damages, a sprained ankle, and consider whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for that injury. Seems like a good case for dismissal to me, but you don’t have to decide that to answer the question."

			"context": "Aggregation of damages in diversity cases If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ‘‘aggregation’’ problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot ‘‘aggregate’’ claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a ‘‘common, undivided interest.’’ (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. §1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.",

Maurice does not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement against either defendant.",
			"ground_truth":"Let’s review the choices in reverse order.  D  is wrong, because Maurice does meet the amount requirement against O’Connell. One plaintiff can add up whatever claims he asserts against a particular defendant to meet the amount requirement, so Maurice can add his $25,000 and $65,000 claims against O’Connell to meet the requirement. C  doesn’t cut the mustard either. The courts have generally taken the position that Maurice must seek more than $75,000 against Parker to meet the amount requirement. 2  He can’t bootstrap a claim against Parker for less than the required amount onto his claim against O’Connell for more. And  B  is wrong, because the aggregation rules don’t allow aggregation of amounts sought against different defendants. A  is correct.

			"context": "Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000.",

He claims that Curly caused the accident, and that he suffered $60,000 in damages from a broken leg suffered in the accident. He further claims that Dr. Moe negligently set the leg after the accident, causing an additional $30,000 in damages.",
			"ground_truth":"Let’s dispose of Larry, Moe, and Curly, and then we’ll move on to other matters. The last choice,  D , is the most interesting here, but it isn’t the right answer. Under the law of causation in tort law, Curly would probably be liable for the $60,000 in initial injuries to Larry and the additional $30,000 due to Dr. Moe’s malpractice. Larry would not have suffered the malpractice if he had not been injured in the accident, so most jurisdictions would hold Curly liable for this additional loss as well as the broken leg. So, the amount requirement is met as to him. But Dr. Moe is only liable for the $30,000 in damages that he caused, so the amount requirement is not met as to him. And Larry cannot aggregate his claim against Dr. Moe with his claim against Curly. Under the traditional aggregation rules, the plaintiff must seek more than $75,000 from each defendant. And that rule has not been changed by 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute. See 28 U.S.C. §1367(b) (barring supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Fed. R. Civ. P. 20). A  isn’t right because the amount requirement is not met by either plaintiff, and they can’t be added together.  B  is no good either. The amount requirement must be assessed based only on the plaintiff’s claim, without regard to the value of any counterclaim. If Curly had brought the initial suit (and the claim for $100,000 were colorable), the court would have had jurisdiction. But Larry brought it, and sues for less, so his claim does not support original jurisdiction. The claims in  C  do satisfy the amount requirement, however. Here, either defendant might be found to have negligently caused Larry’s injuries, so either might be liable for his full $100,000 in damages. Go with  C."

			"context": "The  Grable  problem: State law claims that require proof of federal law. Under Mottley, the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises ‘‘under the law that creates the cause of action.’’ The Mottleys’ claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn’t that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff’s cause of action still ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation’s powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title—a state law property claim—to recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law—the type of notice required by the federal statute—in order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. §1331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be ‘‘substantial,’’ 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies —such as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court. After Grable , federal courts must make sensitive judgments about the importance of the embedded federal issue, and such issues will sometimes, but not always, support arising-under jurisdiction. If this standard appears murky, it is, but perhaps has to be to accommodate the various interests at stake in such cases. Here is a question to test your understanding of this problematic exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule.",

They allege that the Railroad refused to renew their passes because of a new federal statute barring free passes, but also allege that the statute only applies to passes granted after its enactment.

D.  grant the motion only if it concludes that the federal statute does not bar renewal of the Mottleys’ passes",
			"ground_truth":"The correct answer is A; the case should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. This case is not like Grable, because the Mottleys do not have to prove any proposition of federal law to establish their claim. All they need to prove is that they had a contract and that the railroad has failed to perform it. (So C is wrong.) There is no federal issue embedded in their claim. The federal statute will be raised as a defense by the railroad. After Grable, as before, courts still look only to the plaintiff’s case to determine whether the case arises under federal law. The plaintiffs’ case here does not require any allegation or proof of a proposition of federal law. B is also wrong, because even if the applicability of the new federal statute is a substantial question of federal law, it is not one that the Mottleys must establish to prove their claim—the railroad must prove it to establish a defense. D is wrong too. The federal court need not decide whether the statute bars renewal . . . in fact, it can’t decide that, because it doesn’t have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.

			"context": "The relation between constitutional and statutory limits on ‘‘arising under’’ jurisdiction. Article III, §2 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases ‘‘arising under’’ federal law. And 28 U.S.C. §1331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase ‘‘arising under federal law’’ in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff’s complaint, shouldn’t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, §2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated’s in Question 1 , which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley ’s construction of the arising-under statute. In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States , 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of the case. Certainly, federal law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the  Mottley  rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. §1331. Although this has been clear since  Osborn,  Congress has never repudiated  Mottley,  because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under §1331, consider the following question.",

This case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is construed in both 28 U.S.C. §1331 and in Article III, §2 of the United States Constitution, if the case is removed to federal court after the defendant has answered the complaint in state court, asserting his federal defense",
			"ground_truth":"The point of this example is to illustrate the distinction between  Mottley ’s narrow interpretation of arising-under jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. §1331 and  Osborn ’s much more expansive interpretation of the same language in Article III, §2. The facts here are essentially a clone of  Mottley.  The plaintiff sues under state contract law, and the defendant asserts a federal defense to the claim. This is clearly not an arising-under case under the  Mottley  interpretation of §1331, because the plaintiff’s well-pleaded complaint asserts only a state law claim. So  A  and  B  are both wrong: In order to satisfy the arising-under statute, §1331, the plaintiff herself must assert a right to relief under federal law, and Eleanor’s claim is based on state contract law. 1  And since, under Mottley,  the court will only look at the plaintiff’s complaint, not at the answer, in determining whether it has jurisdiction under §1331,  D  is wrong as well. The defendant’s federal defense in his answer will be disregarded in evaluating the court’s jurisdiction, even if the answer is already before the court when it determines the jurisdiction question. So  C  is the right answer. The case is within the constitutional grant of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III: Franklin’s federal law defense makes federal law an ‘‘ingredient’’ of the case, even though that ingredient is injected by the defendant, not the plaintiff. But the case is not proper under §1331, because  Mottley ’s well-pleaded complaint rule (still the governing interpretation of §1332(a)) requires that the plaintiff rely on federal law to make her claim."
