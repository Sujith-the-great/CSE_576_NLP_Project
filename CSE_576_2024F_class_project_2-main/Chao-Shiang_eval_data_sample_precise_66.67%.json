If someone stays in a state with no clear intention to depart, it suggests an open-ended stay, which implies a new domicile.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. Marla moved to Colorado for a two-year program but has plans to stay or leave depending on her experience.\n2. Her current situation is indefinite, and she may choose to remain in Colorado after completing the program.\n3.

This means that to establish a new domicile, one must reside in a state with the intention of staying there indefinitely, without a definite plan to leave at a specific time or on a particular event.\n\n**Step 2:** Apply Rule 3: If a person resides in a state without definite plans to leave, they establish a new domicile there. This is relevant because Marla moved to Colorado for a two-year program but has no clear intention of leaving or staying forever. Her situation is indefinite, and she may choose to remain in Colorado after completing the program.\n\n**Step 3:** Consider Counterargument A: \"But what about her plans to go back?\" While it's true that Marla might return to Montana if she doesn't like being a stylist or decides to pursue other opportunities elsewhere, this doesn't necessarily mean she intends to leave Colorado immediately. Her decision to stay in Colorado or return to Montana is still uncertain.\n\n**Step 4:** Consider Counterargument B: \"Marla's still got ties to Montana!\" It's true that Marla grew up in Montana and may return there after completing the program, but this doesn't necessarily mean she intends to maintain her original domicile. The fact that she moved to Colorado for a two-year program suggests an intention to establish a new life there.\n\n**Step 5:** Analyze the situation. Marla resides in Colorado without definite plans to leave, which means we can apply Rule 3 to determine that she establishes a new domicile in Colorado.

To determine if a case can be removed, we need to check if it could have been filed originally in federal court.\n2. The first step is to identify whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction (e.g., diversity, arising-under, etc.).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. In this case, Castor Chemical Company sues Pollux for breach of contract, claiming that Pollux agreed to manufacture a drug but then reneged.\n2.

If it's an arising-under case, we then check if it meets the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. **Option A**: The action is properly removed because Pollux raised a federal law issue in his answer.\n\t* Counterargument: This approach seems to focus on whether a federal issue will be litigated, rather than whether the case could have been filed originally in federal court.\n2. **Option B**: The action arises under federal law within the meaning of Article III, \u00a72.\n\t* Counterargument: While it's true that Pollux injected a federal ingredient into the case with his affirmative defense, we need to consider whether the plaintiff's original complaint could have been filed in federal court.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1.

        "reasoning step": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1:** Determine if the case can be removed to federal court\nTo do this, we need to check if the plaintiff's original complaint could have been filed in federal court. This involves identifying whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction (e.g., diversity, arising-under, etc.).\n\n**Step 2:** Identify the type of case - diversity or arising-under\nThe plaintiff, Castor Chemical Company, sues Pollux for breach of contract, claiming that Pollux agreed to manufacture a drug but then reneged. This is a typical state-law claim.\n\n**Step 3:** Consider whether the affirmative defense raises a federal law issue\nPollux's answer and affirmative defense mention a patent issue, which introduces a federal ingredient into the case. However, we need to consider whether this affects our analysis of the plaintiff's original complaint.\n\n**Step 4:** Analyze whether the case meets the requirements for arising-under jurisdiction\nTo be an arising-under case, the claim must \"arise under\" federal law within the meaning of Article III, \u00a72. This means that the claim itself must be based on federal law or the Constitution.\n\n**Step 5:** Consider whether the plaintiff's original complaint could have been filed in federal court as a diversity case\nSince the plaintiff and defendant are both from California (i.e., citizens of the same state), this is not a diversity case. However, we can still consider whether it could have been filed in federal court under another category of jurisdiction.\n\n**Step 6:** Conclusion\nAfter analyzing the steps above, I realize that we need to determine if the plaintiff's original complaint could have been filed in federal court as an arising-under case or under some other category of federal jurisdiction. However, since the patent issue is only raised in Pollux's affirmative defense and not by the plaintiff, it doesn't change the nature of the plaintiff's claim.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe action cannot be properly removed because it does not \"arise under\" federal law within the meaning of Article III, \u00a72. The original complaint filed by Castor Chemical Company is based on a state-law breach of contract claim and does not meet the requirements for arising-under jurisdiction.

Neff (1877)\n\n**Rule:** Under the early law of personal jurisdiction, represented by Pennoyer v. Neff, a court has authority over a defendant within its territorial boundaries, and jurisdiction is acquired through symbolic service of process (i.e., serving legal documents).\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The sheriff's power to arrest and detain a defendant who is physically present in the state grants the court jurisdiction.\n2. Symbolic seizure, achieved through personal delivery of court papers, substitutes for physical arrest.\n3. Once jurisdiction is acquired, it continues throughout the litigation, even if the defendant leaves the state.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The question presents a scenario where Neff was served with process in Oregon while visiting on unrelated business.\n2. To determine whether the Oregon court has personal jurisdiction over Neff, we must consider the rule that jurisdiction is acquired through symbolic service of process within the territorial boundaries of the state.\n3. The distractors (B, C, and D) present misconceptions about this principle, such as requiring a connection between Neff's reason for being in Oregon and the lawsuit, or needing Neff to remain physically present in the state throughout the litigation.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. B suggests that Neff could only be subjected to jurisdiction through in-state service if he was in the state for some reason connected to the plaintiff's claim.\n2.

D proposes that jurisdiction could only be acquired by in-state service of process for claims that arose within the state.\n\n**Conclusion:** By analyzing the scenario through the lens of Pennoyer's rule, we can see that the correct answer is A: The Oregon court has personal jurisdiction over Neff because he was served with process in Oregon while physically present.",

This is different from specific in personam jurisdiction, which requires that the claim itself arise out of the defendant's contacts with the forum state.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Identify the defendant's contacts with the forum state**: Consider whether the defendant has a significant presence or activity within the forum state.\n2. **Determine if the claim arises from those contacts**: Check if the plaintiff's claim is directly related to the defendant's contacts with the forum state.\n3. **Consider whether general in personam jurisdiction applies**: If the defendant's contacts are extensive and continuous, and the claim does not need to arise from them (i.e., it's a \"general\" claim), then we may be able to invoke general in personam jurisdiction.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n* The defendant may argue that their contacts with the forum state are insufficient or not substantial enough to support general in personam jurisdiction.\n* The plaintiff may argue that the claim does not arise from the defendant's contacts with the forum state, making specific in personam jurisdiction more appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis and consideration of the rule, we can determine whether a court can rely on general in personam jurisdiction as the basis for exercising judicial authority over the defendant.",

State legislatures define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction through statutes.\n\n**Rule 2: Constitutional Constraints**\nEven if a court has statutory authority to exercise personal jurisdiction, it must also meet constitutional constraints under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Explanation:** The court's assertion of jurisdiction must be fair and not exceed the bounds permitted by due process analysis. This requires a basis for exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant, such as minimum contacts or deliberate contacts with the forum state.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* **Statutory Authority**: Is the Acadia statute (long-arm statute) authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction over Margules?

        "reasoning step": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning and clarifications:\n\n**Step 1: Statutory Authorization**\n\n* The Acadia long-arm statute authorizes personal jurisdiction over a defendant who \"causes personal injury in this state by a tortious act or omission while physically present within this state.\"\n* However, Margules was not physically present in Acadia when she made the defamatory call. She was in Montana.\n* Therefore, the Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case.\n\n**Clarification:** Statutory authorization is about whether a specific statute (in this case, the long-arm statute) allows the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant.\n\n**Step 2: Constitutional Constraints**\n\n* The Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause requires that personal jurisdiction be fair and not exceed bounds permitted by due process analysis.\n* Margules' defamatory call was made from Montana, but it targeted an Acadia company (Acme Corporation) and affected an Acadia resident (Perrone).\n* While there are minimum contacts between Margules and Acadia through the claim, these contacts were made from Montana, not directly from Acadia.\n* The Due Process Clause does not allow personal jurisdiction over a defendant based solely on a call made from another state, especially when no physical presence or direct contact with the forum state is involved.\n\n**Clarification:** Constitutional constraints are about whether exercising personal jurisdiction would be fair and within constitutional limits. In this case, it would be unfair to subject Margules to Acadia's jurisdiction without any significant connections between her and the state.\n\n**Combining Steps 1 & 2**\n\n* The court cannot exercise jurisdiction over Margules under the Acadia long-arm statute because she was not physically present in Acadia when she committed the tortious act.\n* Even if the statute authorized jurisdiction, it would still be unconstitutional to exert jurisdiction over her on these facts due to lack of significant contacts with Acadia.\n\n**The Correct Answer is: B.

(1950) established that due process requires notice reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The Due Process Clause requires a court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment.\n2. In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., the Supreme Court held that due process requires notice reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The court in Mullane considered several factors, including:\n\t* The statute provided for the appointment of a guardian to represent the interests of beneficiaries.\n\t* Even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice, many would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of accounts.\n2. These factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. Option A suggests that every person whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding. However, this would impose an impractical burden on the court and could lead to unnecessary costs.\n2. Option B proposes that every person whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding. This would also impose a significant burden and may not be feasible in all cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1. The correct answer is not explicitly stated, but can be inferred based on the analysis and counterarguments.\n2. The key takeaway is that due process requires notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action, taking into account various factors such as the risk of error, cost, and likelihood of protecting absentee interests.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to generate any further components!",
        "reasoning step": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n**Step 1:** Understanding the context\nWe're discussing the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The question focuses on the notification aspect of due process in civil proceedings.\n\n**Step 2:** Identifying the central issue\nThe main concern is what constitutes constitutionally adequate notice to a defendant in a lawsuit. This involves analyzing the methods of service mentioned (personal service, leaving papers with someone at home or business, certified mail, ordinary mail, and publication) through the lens of Justice Jackson's opinion in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co.\n\n**Step 3:** Recalling the key principles from Mullane\nMullane established that due process requires notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections (339 U.S. at 314). The Court emphasized that what is reasonable in one circumstance might not satisfy due process in another.\n\n**Step 4:** Considering the factors from Mullane\nThe Supreme Court took into account several factors when determining that notice by mail was sufficient in Mullane:\n\t* Difficulty in ascertaining who all the beneficiaries were.\n\t* Presence of contingent beneficiaries, whose interests would be affected by the proceeding.\n\t* Statutory provision for appointing a guardian to represent the interests of all beneficiaries.\n\t* Shared representation by beneficiaries who did receive notice.\n\n**Step 5:** Evaluating the answer options\nLet's examine each option in light of the principles from Mullane:\n\nA. Every person whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding.\nThis option seems too broad and might not take into account all the nuances present in Mullane.\n\nB. Every person whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding.\nWhile this approach would likely provide adequate notice, it's unclear whether \"reasonable investigation\" is explicitly mentioned in Mullane or if it would always be feasible.\n\nC. Any person whose interests might be affected by the proceeding must be given notice by in-hand service of process.\nThis option seems too rigid and ignores the factors considered in Mullane.\n\nD. Due to the large number of persons whose interests might be affected by the proceedings, notice by publication was sufficient on the facts of the case.\nNotice by publication is indeed mentioned in the question as a possible method of serving process, but it's not explicitly stated that it was deemed sufficient due to the number of people involved.\n\nE.

However, this argument can be countered by considering the language of \u00a71391(b)(2), which allows for venue in any district where \"a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred.\"\n\nAnother possible counterargument is that the Western District of Kentucky should also be considered a valid option under \u00a71391(b)(3). However, this argument can be countered by considering the fact that there are other districts (e.g., Southern District of Ohio and Western District of Tennessee) where venue would be proper under subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2), which makes \u00a71391(b)(3) inapplicable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, it appears that the correct answer is the Southern District of Ohio. This district meets the criteria for venue under \u00a71391(b)(2).",

This means that there is no limit to the number of claims that can be joined, as long as they are against the same opposing party.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the nature of the claims being joined**\nFelina's complaint includes three claims: an ADEA claim (age discrimination), a breach of fiduciary duty claim related to the land purchase venture, and a specific performance claim also related to the land purchase venture. We need to determine if these claims can be joined together.\n\n**Step 4: Recognize that there is no requirement for the claims to arise from the same transaction or occurrence**\nThe rule does not require that the claims arise from the same transaction or occurrence. This means that Felina's ADEA claim and her two contract claims do not need to share a common factual basis.\n\n**Step 5: Note that the court can hear and determine both legal and equitable claims**\nThe rule allows for the joinder of both legal and equitable claims. This means that Felina's ADEA claim (a legal claim) and her specific performance claim (an equitable claim) can be joined together in a single lawsuit.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. **Efficiency:** One might argue that it would be more efficient to separate the unrelated ADEA claim from the contract claims.

The twenty-one day limit for amending as a matter of course runs from service of the opposing party's responsive pleading or motion, not from the filing of the original complaint.\n2. Malone served his motion to dismiss (a Rule 12 motion) on January 22, which starts the clock for Farrell to amend her complaint.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. A possible argument is that the twenty-one day limit has expired since Farrell's amendment was filed more than twenty-one days after serving the original complaint.\n2. Another counterargument could be that adding a new claim for different damages or events constitutes an improper amendment under Rule 15.\n\n**Counterarguments' Responses:**\n\n1. The twenty-one day limit for amending as a matter of course runs from service of the opposing party's responsive pleading or motion, not from the filing of the original complaint (Fed. R. Civ.

Another argument might suggest that adding a new claim for different damages constitutes an improper amendment under Rule 15, but this is not correct since Rule 15 places no such limits on substantive changes.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Farrell's amendment is timely because it was filed within twenty-one days after Malone served his Rule 12 motion, and the addition of a new claim does not violate any provisions in Fed.

P. 12(b), she can either put every defense to a claim in her answer to the complaint or raise certain objections by a \"pre-answer motion\" before pleading.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis**\nThe objection raised by Trinh is to personal jurisdiction, which is one of the defenses listed in Rule 12(b) that can be made by a pre-answer motion. However, according to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4), if the defendant has an objection listed in Rule 12(b), she may raise it in her answer instead of making a pre-answer motion.\n\n**Step 3: Counterarguments**\nOne might argue that Trinh waived this objection by failing to make a pre-answer motion, but Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4) clearly allows for objections listed in Rule 12(b) to be raised in the answer instead of making a pre-answer motion.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nTherefore, Trinh's objection to personal jurisdiction is properly raised in her answer, and the court will consider and decide this objection as part of the responsive pleading.\n\n<The correct answer is: A>",

        "reasoning step": "To determine how New Era should proceed, let's break down the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding Rule 26(a)(1)**: This rule requires automatic disclosure of certain categories of information among parties without a request from the other side. The disclosures include:\n\t* Disclosure of individuals likely to have discoverable information\n\t* Copies or descriptions of documents and things in possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party\n\t* Computation of damages claimed\n\t* Insurance agreements under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action\n\n2. **New Era's Situation**: New Era learns about a letter from an individual claiming copyright on the shipwreck story, which Fremont failed to disclose in its Rule 26(a) disclosures.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Letter's Relevance**: The letter is likely relevant to the claim or defense of either party since it pertains to the ownership of the copyrighted material. This means the letter can be considered \"discoverable\" under Rule 26(b)(1).\n\n4. **Considering Fremont's Failure to Disclose**: Since Fremont failed to disclose the letter in its initial disclosures, New Era needs to determine how to obtain this information.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Options**:\n\t* A. Moving for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1): This might not be effective if the letter is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a). Since Fremont's failure to disclose doesn't necessarily mean they intended to withhold relevant information, moving for sanctions could be premature.\n\t* B. Moving to require supplemental disclosure of the letter: Given that the letter likely falls under the scope of Rule 26(b)(1), requesting a supplemental disclosure might be an efficient way to obtain this information without delving into more extensive discovery.\n\t* C. Sending Fremont a Rule 34 Request for Production of documents to obtain the letter: While this is an option, it might not be necessary if the letter can be obtained through a more streamlined process like supplemental disclosure.\n\t* D. The statement that the letter cannot be obtained because it's not subject to disclosure is incorrect. Since the letter is likely relevant under Rule 26(b)(1), it can still be obtained through discovery.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on these steps, the most appropriate course of action for New Era would be to move to require supplemental disclosure of the letter (Option B). This allows for a more direct and efficient way to obtain the necessary information without escalating the situation further.",

This means that plaintiffs must claim an amount exceeding $75,000 to meet the statutory requirement for federal jurisdiction.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Article III Authority:** Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution broadly authorizes diversity jurisdiction without a monetary restriction.\n2. **Congressional Grant:** Congress has chosen to impose an amount-in-controversy requirement on diversity jurisdiction through the statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a).\n3. **Purpose:** The purpose of this requirement is to keep small diversity cases out of federal court and ensure that only significant disputes are heard in the federal system.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. **Constitutional Authority:** Some might argue that Congress has overstepped its constitutional authority by imposing an amount-in-controversy requirement on diversity jurisdiction, which was not explicitly authorized by Article III.\n2. **Practical Concerns:** Others might suggest that the $75,000 threshold is too low and allows frivolous cases to clog up the federal courts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1. **Statutory Requirement:** The amount-in-controversy requirement of $75,000, exclusive of interest or costs, remains a statutory hurdle for plaintiffs seeking diversity jurisdiction in federal court.\n2. **Congressional Discretion:** Congress has the authority to adjust or eliminate this requirement as it sees fit, but so far, it has chosen to maintain the existing threshold.\n\nNow, let's see if you can use these components to reach the correct answer!",
        "reasoning step": "Here are my step-by-step reasoning and clarifications:\n\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Topic**\nThe topic here is about the amount-in-controversy requirement in diversity jurisdiction.

Option C and D suggest amounts above $75,000, but this doesn't align with the requirement. Option B states that interest and costs are not counted, which matches our rule.\n\n\n**Step 5: Selecting the Correct Answer**\nBased on our analysis in step 4, we can see that option B is the only one that correctly reflects the amount-in-controversy requirement of $75,000, exclusive of interest or costs.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer is indeed:\n\n<The correct answer is: B.>",

Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283 (1938) - the \"St. Paul Mercury rule\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. The St. Paul Mercury rule states that a court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff's claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000.\n2. The court will evaluate the plaintiff's injuries or damages and consider whether a jury would likely award more than $75,000.\n3. If the judge concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is \"to a legal certainty\" worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. The court will not simply accept the number Wanda's lawyer asks for in damages; it will look at the actual injury Wanda has suffered.\n2. The court will consider whether those injuries could rationally support a verdict over the required amount of $75,000.\n3. If the damages are in the debatable range, where a reasonable jury might award more or less than $75,000, the amount requirement is met.\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n1. A counterargument to option D is that simply demanding large damages would not be sufficient; the court must consider the actual injury.\n2. Another counterargument to option C is that it misperceives the St. Paul Mercury test, suggesting that the plaintiff must definitely recover more than $75,000.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n1. Based on the St. Paul Mercury rule and analysis, the correct answer can be deduced.\n2.

If the judge concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, the claim is \"to a legal certainty\" worth less than the amount required.\n\n**Step 3:** Analyze the given information\nWanda demands $100,000 in damages for her injuries, which are a badly sprained ankle. However, Peroski denies that his conduct was negligent, so it's unclear whether Wanda will be able to prove negligence and recover damages.\n\n**Step 4:** Determine the correct approach\nBased on the St. Paul Mercury rule, the court should consider whether Wanda's actual injuries could rationally support a verdict over $75,000, rather than simply accepting her demand for $100,000.\n\n**Step 5:** Consider the options\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent.\nThis option focuses on proving negligence, which is not directly relevant to determining the amount-in-controversy.\n\nB. To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges.\nThis option aligns with the St. Paul Mercury rule and focuses on the actual damages suffered by Wanda.\n\nC. The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda's damages exceed $75,000.\nThis option misperceives the St. Paul Mercury test, suggesting that the plaintiff must definitely recover more than $75,000.\n\nD. The amount-in-controversy requirement is met, because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages.\nThis option ignores the court's need to consider the actual injuries and whether a jury would likely award more than $75,000.\n\n**Step 6:** Choose the correct answer\nBased on the analysis, I believe that B is the most accurate statement. The court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for Wanda's injuries, rather than simply considering her demand or the probability of proving negligence.\n\nThe correct answer is: <B>",

Kansas City Title and Trust Co., and Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co.\n\n**Explanation:** To determine whether a case arises under federal law, we look to see if the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If they do, the case \"arises under\" federal law, and the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. However, this does not mean that every time a plaintiff needs to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim, the case will qualify for arising-under jurisdiction.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n* What is the main claim of the Mottleys in their lawsuit against the Railroad?\n* Does the Mottleys' claim require them to assert a right to relief under federal law?\n* Does the Mottleys' claim need to prove a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim?\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n* The plaintiff's case might seem similar to Grable, but what are the key differences between the two cases?\n* Even if the applicability of the new federal statute is a substantial question of federal law, does it have to be established by the Mottleys or can it be raised as a defense by the Railroad?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* Based on the analysis and counterarguments, what is the most likely outcome in terms of subject matter jurisdiction for the Mottleys' lawsuit against the Railroad?",
        "reasoning step": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Topic**\n\n* The topic is the Grable problem and subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.\n* We need to determine whether a case arises under federal law, which requires that a plaintiff assert a right to relief under federal law.\n\n**Step 2: Review the Rule**\n\n* The well-pleaded complaint rule states that federal questions must be raised in a properly pleaded claim or defense to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on a court.\n* However, if the plaintiff's state-law claim requires her to prove a substantial issue of federal law, then the case \"arises under\" federal law and the court has subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Mottleys' Claim**\n\n* The Mottleys are suing the Railroad for breach of contract, claiming that it had agreed to renew their passes for life.\n* They allege that the Railroad refused to renew their passes because of a new federal statute barring free passes, but also claim that the statute only applies to passes granted after its enactment.\n\n**Step 4: Determine Whether Federal Law is Asserted**\n\n* The Mottleys' main claim is based on state contract law, not federal law.\n* However, they do assert that their passes are exempt from the new federal statute, which means they are claiming a right under federal law.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Grable Exception**\n\n* According to Grable, if the plaintiff's state-law claim requires her to prove a substantial issue of federal law, then the case \"arises under\" federal law.\n* The Mottleys' claim does require them to establish whether the new federal statute applies to their passes (which were issued before its enactment).\n\n**Step 6: Analyze the Situation**\n\n* If the Mottleys succeed in establishing that the federal statute only applies to passes granted after its passage, then they have effectively established a right under federal law.\n* This would mean that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over their claim.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* Based on these steps, it seems likely that the Mottleys' case would be allowed to proceed in federal court, since they are asserting a right under federal law and their state-law claim requires them to establish whether the new federal statute applies to their passes.\n\n**The Correct Answer is: B.**",
