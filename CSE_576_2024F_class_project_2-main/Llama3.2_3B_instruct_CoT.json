A person's domicile is determined by her current most recent residence with the intent to remain indefinitely.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Marla's situation\nMarla moved from Montana to Colorado after high school for a two-year program at the Denver Beauty School. She initially planned to stay if she liked it and get a job as a stylist in Denver or elsewhere in the West, including Montana. Her lease is for six months, indicating an open-ended basis.\n\nStep 3: Identify the key factors\nThe key factors are Marla's current residence (Colorado) and her intent to remain indefinitely. The \"residence\" requirement can be satisfied by staying overnight, as mentioned in the text. However, establishing an \"indefinite\" intent is more challenging.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each option\nOption A: Incorrect - Marla doesn't remain domiciled in Montana because she moved out after high school.\nOption B: Incorrect - While Marla may return to Montana for work, her current residence and intent suggest that Colorado should be the domicile.\nOption C: Incorrect - Marla's previous domicile (Montana) does not automatically become her current domicile, as she has resided in Colorado with a new intention.\nOption D: Correct - Given Marla resides in Colorado on an open-ended basis (six-month lease), with no clear plan to leave, it is reasonable to conclude that she intends to remain indefinitely in Colorado.\n\nStep 5: Verify the answer\nBased on the \"reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely\" test, we can verify that Marla's current residence in Colorado, combined with her open-ended intentions (leaving only when she finds a job or decides otherwise), aligns with the domicile test criteria.\n\nThe answer is: D",

According to the text, a party can prove their intent to remain in a state through practical evidence, such as where they vote, have health insurance, rent an apartment, register a car, and so forth. However, this evidence alone does not automatically establish domicile; it must be considered along with the party's testimony.\n\n3. Rossi has established some of these practical factors in Idaho, such as registering her car, establishing a bank account, getting health coverage through college, renting an apartment, having a part-time job, and paying Idaho state taxes. These factors suggest that Rossi intends to remain in Idaho.\n\n4. However, Rossi's ultimate plan is to return to Pennsylvania after completing her degree, which suggests that she may not intend to remain in Idaho permanently.\n\n5. The court will consider both Rossi's testimony and the practical evidence she has established in Idaho to determine her intent.\n\n6. Now, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Option A: This is incorrect because being only a student does not necessarily mean Rossi intends to remain in Pennsylvania.\n\nB. Option B: While it is true that Rossi intends to return to Pennsylvania after completing her degree, the fact remains that she has established some practical factors in Idaho, such as registering her car and renting an apartment, which suggests she may intend to remain in Idaho for a period of time.\n\nC. Option C: This option incorrectly concludes that because Rossi has established many practical factors in Idaho, she must be domiciled there. However, the text reminds us that evidence alone does not automatically establish domicile; it must be considered along with the party's testimony.\n\nD. Option D: This is correct because it recognizes that Rossi may intend to remain in Idaho for a period of time (until she completes her degree), even if she doesn't know exactly when that will happen.\n\nE. Option E: While this option mentions that Rossi plans to testify in her deposition, it does not consider the practical evidence she has established in Idaho, which also suggests she may intend to remain there.\n\nThe answer is: D",

The court must determine whether the case meets the complete diversity requirement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1).\n\nStep 2: Identify the principal place of business\nThe key issue is to determine where Apex's principal place of business is located. According to Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010), a corporation's principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the facts\nApex Corporation has a factory in El Paso, Texas, which employs 500 employees and assembles lawnmowers. It also has another factory in Tennessee that manufactures handles for the mowers and employs 25 employees. Additionally, Apex's corporate headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with 15 officers and employees working out of the office.\n\nStep 4: Apply the legal principle\nUnder Hertz Corp. v. Friend, a corporation's principal place of business is determined by its headquarters, regardless of other activities. In this case, Apex's headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nStep 5: Determine the citizen of the state\nSince Apex's principal place of business is Oklahoma, it is considered a citizen of Oklahoma under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1). The court must then determine whether there is complete diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex.\n\nStep 6: Check for diversity between parties\nThe plaintiffs are from Texas, and Apex is from Oklahoma. To determine diversity, we need to check if both parties meet the requirements of complete diversity.\n\nStep 7: Analyze the citizenship requirements\nFor a party to be considered a citizen of a state under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1), it must meet one of the following criteria:\n\n- Be a citizen of that state.\n- Be incorporated in or doing business in that state.\n- Have its principal place of business in that state.\n\nSince Apex is incorporated in Delaware, not Oklahoma, and does not meet the other criteria for complete diversity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1), we can conclude:\n\nThe answer is: D",

Section 1332(a)(2) specifies that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the same state.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each individual case presented:\n\n- Crandall and Rizzouti suing Janssen (both citizens of Iowa and Vermont, respectively), which falls under diversity jurisdiction.\n- Gompers being an American citizen but living in Great Britain indefinitely, meaning he is not domiciled in any U.S. state, thus no federal jurisdiction applies due to his citizenship status outside the U.S.\n- Toussaint, a French national (alien) with no permanent residence or domicile in Iowa.\n\nStep 4: Apply the diversity statute and legal principles:\n\n- Option A suggests there's no jurisdiction because Toussaint is a citizen of Iowa. However, as an alien not admitted for permanent residence, she cannot bring a diversity action against a U.S. citizen in federal court.\n- Option B implies that removing Gompers from the case would allow the suit to proceed. While true for his claims against Crandall and Rizzouti, it does not address the jurisdiction over Toussaint's claims against Janssen or those involving Gompers himself.\n- Option C correctly states there is no jurisdiction because Toussaint is an alien domiciled in Iowa, unable to bring a diversity action against a U.S. citizen (Janssen).\n- Option D incorrectly implies that all cases could proceed together under some form of federal jurisdiction when, in fact, Gompers' presence complicates the jurisdiction over his claims involving aliens and non-U.S. citizens.\n\nStep 5: Conclude based on the analysis:\n\nThe answer is: C",

        "reasoning step": "Step 1: Understand the context of the question\nThe question revolves around the relationship between statutory diversity jurisdiction and the constitutional grant in Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution. Specifically, it discusses the interpretation of \"citizens of different states\" in Article III and how this relates to complete or minimal diversity.\n\nStep 2: Identify key legal precedents\nTwo significant cases are mentioned: Strawbridge v. Curtiss (which held that all defendants must be diverse from all plaintiffs) and State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire (which ruled that Strawbridge interpreted the diversity statute, not Article III).\n\nStep 3: Clarify the jurisdiction under Article III\nState Farm v. Tashire established that for Article III purposes, a case is considered \"between citizens of different states\" if at least one plaintiff is diverse from one defendant. This implies minimal diversity, contrary to Strawbridge's interpretation.\n\nStep 4: Consider the legislative grant of diversity jurisdiction\nThe jurisdiction allowed under the Constitution is not self-executing; it depends on Congress's authorization. The federal district courts derive their power from congressional grants.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate Smith\u2019s proposed bill\nSmith\u2019s bill aims to allow diversity jurisdiction \"so long as at least one plaintiff in the case is a citizen of a different state from one defendant.\" Given that State Farm v. Tashire has established that Article III allows for minimal diversity (i.e., at least one party being diverse from another), this bill aligns with the current understanding of the scope of diversity jurisdiction under Article III.\n\nStep 6: Consider the constitutionality of Smith\u2019s bill\nSince Congress can expand or restrict the jurisdiction of the federal district courts as it sees fit, and given that minimal diversity is allowed under Article III, Smith\u2019s bill would not violate the Constitution. The key factor is whether it respects the established constitutional scope of Article III.\n\nStep 7: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the legal context, including the interpretations provided by State Farm v. Tashire and the understanding that Congress can modify the legislative grant of diversity jurisdiction as needed, Smith\u2019s bill does not conflict with the Constitution.\n\nThe answer is: A",

Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution creates diversity jurisdiction in very general terms but does not expressly state whether there must be 'complete diversity' or if some plaintiffs can be diverse from some defendants.\n\n2. The Strawbridge v. Curtiss case (1826) held that all defendants must be diverse from all plaintiffs for complete diversity to exist, under Article III interpretation.\n\n3. However, in State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire (1967), the Supreme Court held that Strawbridge interpreted the diversity statute (28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)), not Article III. As a result, for Article III purposes, minimal diversity is enough; some plaintiff must be diverse from some defendant.\n\n4. Nevertheless, Strawbridge has not been overruled, and Congress has not amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a) to allow diversity jurisdiction based on minimal diversity.\n\n5. The key point is that the scope of diversity jurisdiction under Article III and the congressional grant are not identical; the statutory grant allows only some subset of those cases.\n\n6. Specifically, the amount-in-controversy requirement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a) states that jurisdiction exists over diversity cases in which 'the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.'\n\n7. This means that for a diversity case to be heard in federal court, the amount in controversy must exceed at least $75,000.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. $75,000, counting interest and costs as well as the plaintiff\u2019s damages. - This option exceeds the amount-in-controversy requirement because it includes interest and costs but does not exclude them from being counted towards the jurisdictional threshold.\n\nB. $75,000, not counting interest and costs. - This option is incorrect according to the text because it excludes interest and costs from being considered for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient amount in controversy.\n\nC. $75,000.01, counting interest and costs. - Similar to option A, this exceeds the amount-in-controversy requirement due to including interest and costs but does not exclude them.\n\nD. $75,000.01, exclusive of interest and costs. - This option is the only one that aligns with the correct interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a), which states that jurisdiction exists over diversity cases in which 'the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.'\n\nThe answer is: D",

This interpretation goes beyond the St. Paul Mercury rule and ignores its \"possibility\" standard.\n\nStep 6: Option D evaluation\nOption D states that the amount-in-controversy requirement is met because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages.\nThis option misinterprets the St. Paul Mercury rule, which requires only that it be possible for the plaintiff's claim to support a recovery over $75,000.\n\nThe answer is: B",

In this case, Consolidated Corporation sues Garces for business libel, which is a state-law claim.\n\n4. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - Option A: The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case because the complaint alleges that Garces reported violations to a federal agency. However, this fact alone does not establish federal question jurisdiction based on the plaintiff's reliance on federal law.\n   - Option B: The motion should be denied because the complaint alleges that Garces reported violations to a federal agency. This option is incorrect because it focuses on the existence of a federal issue rather than whether Consolidated Corporation relies on federal law as the source of its right to relief.\n   - Option C: The case involves a question arising under the Constitution of the United States, but this does not address the specific requirement that the plaintiff must rely on federal law as the source of their right to relief.\n   - Option D: Garces's counterclaim arises under federal law because it is based on the Federal Whistleblower Act.

If this interpretation were applied to Article III, \u00a72, it would significantly restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases involving federal defenses and counterclaims.\n\nStep 3: Consider the implications of Mottley rule\nIf the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, \u00a72, it would limit federal court jurisdiction in cases where a federal issue is raised as a defense or counterclaim. This could result in state courts having final authority over federal law questions in those cases.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate Supreme Court decisions\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of Article III arising-under jurisdiction more broadly than Mottley's construction. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law forms an ingredient of the case, including cases with federal defenses or counterclaims.\n\nStep 5: Consider Congress' actions\nDespite recognizing the broader interpretation in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, Congress has not repudiated the Mottley rule, partly to provide clear rules for determining jurisdiction and limiting potential manipulation by parties. This means that while the Supreme Court may have a more expansive view, the statutory interpretation under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 remains influential.\n\nStep 6: Analyze the question of adding an amount-in-controversy requirement\nOption A suggests Congress may expand or restrict federal district court jurisdiction as it sees fit. However, given the historical context and the influence of Mottley's rule, adding a new condition like an amount-in-controversy requirement could be seen as limiting rather than expanding jurisdiction.\n\nStep 7: Apply legal reasoning to the options\nOption B states that Smith's bill would be unconstitutional because it restricts plaintiffs' ability to take cases under federal law to federal court. This option aligns with the Supreme Court's broader interpretation and the practical implications of Mottley's rule, which would limit jurisdiction in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims.\n\nStep 8: Verify the correctness of the answer\nBased on the analysis, Option B seems most consistent with the legal reasoning provided. It respects the influence of the Supreme Court's broad interpretation of Article III arising-under jurisdiction and acknowledges the importance of not restricting plaintiffs' access to federal courts for cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims.\n\nThe answer is: B",

Since Manello is from Kentucky and Antril is from Florida, they are not diverse (therefore no complete diversity). However, because of this lack of diversity, the only way for federal jurisdiction over Manello to exist would be based on supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, which was ruled out in the problem.\n\nTherefore Step 1 indicates that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Antril's claim against Manello.\n\nStep 2: Determine the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal court over Acme\u2019s claim.\n\nAntril asserts a claim under the Federal Toxics Transportation Act (FTTA) for violation by Acme, which is a Florida corporation.

We have a case where Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Isaacs asserts three claims: one under the ADEA, another for breach of contract, and a third for misappropriation of his design.\n\nStep 2: Identify the claims that are properly within federal jurisdiction. The ADEA claim is clearly within federal jurisdiction because it is a federal statutory claim. On the other hand, the breach of contract claim, although arising from the same set of underlying facts as the ADEA claim, would not be within federal jurisdiction unless there was diversity of citizenship among the parties.\n\nStep 3: Check if the claim for misappropriation of his design is properly within federal jurisdiction. The misappropriation claim, like the breach of contract claim, is a state law claim and would not be within federal jurisdiction unless there was diversity of citizenship among the parties.\n\nStep 4: Since the ADEA claim is the only one that is clearly within federal jurisdiction (because it is a federal statutory claim), we can determine that the correct option is related to this claim. Option C states that the court has jurisdiction over the ADEA claim only, which seems plausible given the context.\n\nStep 5: We need to verify if the court also has subject matter jurisdiction over the first two claims (breach of contract and misappropriation of design). As established earlier, these are state law claims that would not be within federal jurisdiction unless there was diversity of citizenship among the parties. However, this option is not directly related to the ADEA claim.\n\nStep 6: Option B states that the court has no jurisdiction over any of the claims because the parties are both from Montana, which means it's a diversity case. While this might seem plausible at first glance, we need to consider whether there is diversity among all three claims or if one of them is a federal claim.\n\nStep 7: Given that only one of the three claims (ADEA) is clearly within federal jurisdiction and meets the conditions for supplemental jurisdiction (arising from the same set of underlying facts as the main federal claim), option C is the most accurate answer.

Taney alleges that Ivanov was negligent and failed to comply with federal structural standards under the Federal Housing Act.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key legal issues at play\nThe dispute centers on subject matter jurisdiction, specifically whether Taney's claim meets the \"arising-under\" standard set forth in Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution. Additionally, we need to consider whether Taney waived any objection to subject matter jurisdiction by litigating the case for ten months without raising the issue.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the pleading process\nTaney filed a complaint, and Ivanov responded with an answer denying liability. This process was followed by discovery, which took place over ten months.\n\nStep 4: Determine when jurisdiction can be raised\nAccording to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3), if it appears that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the court shall dismiss the action. This rule allows parties to object to jurisdiction at any time, including after discovery has begun.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate Taney's motion for dismissal\nTaney now moves to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that his claim does not meet the \"arising-under\" standard. Given that Taney had a sufficient opportunity to raise this issue through discovery, we must consider whether he waived any objection to subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nStep 6: Consider the waiver doctrine\nThe waiver doctrine generally holds that a party waives any objection to subject matter jurisdiction by failing to raise it within a reasonable time after the objection becomes apparent. However, some courts have held that a party can challenge subject matter jurisdiction at any time, even after discovery has begun.\n\nStep 7: Apply the correct legal principle\nIn this case, we must apply the rule that allows parties to object to subject matter jurisdiction \"at any time\" (Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3)).

In this case, the action is a breach of contract claim by Castor against Pollux.\n5. However, there is an additional issue raised by Pollux's affirmative defense: that he learned after making the contract that the drug was covered by a patent, and therefore could not manufacture it without a license to do so.\n6.

Neff theory posits that a court can exercise personal jurisdiction over an individual if the defendant is physically present within the state where the court sits, even if only temporarily. This premise suggests that the physical presence of the defendant (in this case, Neff) in the state is the critical factor for establishing jurisdiction.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Situation**: In Mitchell v. Neff's scenario, Neff is served with process in Oregon while visiting there on unrelated business. It is noted that Neff promptly departed once more for California and has not returned to Oregon since.\n\n3. **Applying Pennoyer\u2019s \u2018Presence Theory\u2019**: According to Pennoyer\u2019s theory, if a defendant is physically present within the state where the court sits, the court can acquire jurisdiction over them. However, being served in a different capacity or purpose does not negate the physical presence requirement for establishing personal jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Evaluating Options**:\n   - **Option A**: This option suggests that the Oregon court has personal jurisdiction over Neff because he was physically present within the state.\n   - **Option B**: This option incorrectly implies that being served in a different capacity (for unrelated business) detracts from Neff\u2019s physical presence, which is not necessarily true under Pennoyer's 'presence theory'.\n   - **Option C**: This option misinterprets Pennoyer's premise by suggesting that the mere absence of the defendant after service negates jurisdiction.

After consulting Mitchell, Neff left Oregon without returning and never paid Mitchell's bill. Mitchell sues Neff in an Oregon state court for his fee.\n\nStep 3: Applying the Pennoyer Framework (Eliminating Options A and C)\nThe Pennoyer framework, which was reaffirmed in Burnham v.

Since Neff was not served in Oregon, under this framework, he would not be subject to jurisdiction in Mitchell's suit.\n\nStep 4: Applying the International Shoe Framework (Selecting Option B)\nThe International Shoe framework, as recognized in International Shoe v. Washington, holds that a defendant with minimum contacts in the state where the action is brought can be subjected to personal jurisdiction in that state.

Now, let's analyze Morales' claim against Cartwright:\n   - Morales brings suit against Cartwright for injuries in a New York state court.\n   - The claim does not arise from Cartwright's New York contacts (the accident happened while driving to a job in Massachusetts).\n\n4. Therefore, based on the International Shoe proposition, since the claim does not arise from Cartwright's voluntary minimum contacts with New York, he is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York.\n\n5. Option A states that Cartwright is subject to personal jurisdiction in New York for this claim because he has minimum contacts in New York.\n   - This statement is incorrect based on our analysis.\n\n6. Option B states that Cartwright is subject to personal jurisdiction in New York based on minimum contacts if New York has a long-arm statute that authorizes jurisdiction in tort cases.\n   - While having minimum contacts with the state and meeting the requirements of a long-arm statute would be necessary for personal jurisdiction, this option does not address why Cartwright's contacts are voluntary and how it relates to the specific claims against him.\n\n7. Option C states that Cartwright is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York because the claim does not arise out of Cartwright\u2019s New York contacts.\n   - This statement aligns with our analysis, which determined that Cartwright is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York based on International Shoe's proposition and Morales' claim against him did not arise from his voluntary minimum contacts with New York.\n\n8. Option D states that Cartwright is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York because his work in New York is a small percentage of his yearly construction business.\n   - While the fact that 5% of his business in NY was for this specific claim does not directly relate to whether he is subject to jurisdiction, our analysis determined that the claim itself did not arise from Cartwright's voluntary minimum contacts with New York.\n\nThe answer is: C",

This is often determined through two key factors: foreseeability and purposeful availment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the concept of foreseeability in minimum contacts jurisdiction.\n\nForeseeability refers to the degree to which a defendant can anticipate that their actions will lead to consequences in a particular state. However, the Court has distinguished between mere foreseeability of events (as in World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson) and the type of \"purposeful availment\" relevant to minimum contacts jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Understand purposeful availment in minimum contacts jurisdiction.\n\nPurposeful availment refers to when a defendant knowingly and voluntarily chooses to interact with people in a state, assuming the risk that suits may be filed there based on those interactions. This conscious decision to engage in activities in a particular state implies that the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\n\nStep 4: Apply this analysis to the given scenario:\n\nAce Truck Bodies sells gasoline tanks to Deuce Petroleum Company in Kansas, which installs them on trucks delivering gas to gas stations throughout the Midwest. When a tank explodes in Illinois during a delivery, Jack sues Ace Truck Bodies in Illinois.\n\nThe key question is whether Ace's actions meet the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate each option:\n\nA. Subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois because it was aware that the tank it sold to Deuce would be used in Illinois.\n- This option focuses on foreseeability, which is not sufficient under World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson.\n\nB. Subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois because it could foresee that its tank, if defective, would cause injury in Illinois.\n- Again, this option revolves around mere foreseeability of events and does not address purposeful availment.\n\nC. Subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois because it committed a tortious act in Illinois under the long-arm statute.\n- This option addresses purposeful availment, as Ace has knowingly engaged with people in Illinois (through Deuce Petroleum Company's use of the tank). However, it is unclear if this action was intentional and purposeful.\n\nD. Not subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois because its contacts with Illinois are insufficient to support jurisdiction under the minimum contacts test.\n- This option acknowledges that Ace did not make a conscious decision to interact with people in Illinois or assume the risk of being sued there.\n\nStep 6: Choose the correct answer based on the analysis:\n\nThe answer is: D.

She also sent a deposit check to him, which indicates that she intended to purchase a car from him. These actions demonstrate that Fein and Lonergan had some level of interaction before the transaction.\n\nStep 2: Reasonableness Test\nThe reasonableness test involves considering various factors, including the plaintiff's interest in obtaining a remedy, the forum state's interest in providing it, and the extent of the inconvenience to the defendant. In this case:\n\n*   Fein has a strong interest in obtaining a remedy because she believes Lonergan committed fraud against her.\n*   Wisconsin has an interest in protecting its citizens from fraud, as reflected in its fraud statute (option B).\n*   The forum state (Wisconsin) is the most convenient location for litigation, since Lonergan lives close to the border.\n\nHowever, these factors do not necessarily mean that Wisconsin will have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan. To determine reasonableness, we must consider whether the defendant's contacts with the forum state outweigh his convenience concerns.\n\nStep 3: Deliberate Contacts\nTo establish minimum contacts under the reasonableness test, Lonergan must demonstrate that he intentionally engaged in activities focused on the forum state (Wisconsin). Although Lonergan is based in Minnesota and interacts with Fein during her visitation, there is no evidence to suggest that he deliberately sought out Fein or conducted business activities in Wisconsin.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis above, Wisconsin will probably not have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan. While Fein has established some level of interaction with Lonergan in Wisconsin, his contacts are not sufficient to meet the minimum contacts test under the reasonableness test.

In this case, Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation has no other contacts in Maryland beyond selling one drill press to Emporia Distributors, which then resold it to Modern Tool and Die Company.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option A\nOption A states that the Maryland court should have jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision because it is an American company. However, this argument is irrelevant to the minimum contacts test and does not address the sufficiency of Atlanta Precision's connections with Maryland.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option B\nOption B suggests that the Maryland court should have jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision because Emporia Distributors, based in Pennsylvania, could foresee that Atlanta Precision's machines would be resold into nearby Maryland. However, this argument is too speculative and does not establish a sufficient connection between Atlanta Precision and Maryland.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option C\nOption C states that the Maryland court should have jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision because it sold its machines in large quantities to a distributor which it expected to resell in other states. While this argument acknowledges Atlanta Precision's expectation of reselling in other states, it does not establish a sufficient connection with Maryland beyond the single sale.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate option D\nOption D states that the Maryland court cannot exercise jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision because its contacts with Maryland are insufficient under the minimum contacts test.

        "reasoning step": "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to determine if the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case based on diversity. To do this, we must check if Quality Auto Parts, Inc., the defendant, and Pontes, the plaintiff, meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332.\n\nThe two parties must be citizens of different states. Quality Auto Parts is incorporated in Delaware (a state that allows corporations to be formed), so it is a citizen of Delaware. Pontes is an Ohio citizen. Since they are both U.S. citizens, we check if the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The problem does not provide information about the damages, but for the sake of argument, let's assume there were no damages (i.e., the claim was for less than $75,000). In this case, the court would have subject matter jurisdiction under diversity.\n\nNow that we have established subject matter jurisdiction, we move on to personal jurisdiction. There are two types: general in personam jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.\n\nThe problem states that Quality Auto Parts' corporate headquarters are located in Indiana. According to the Hertz decision (559 U.S. 77), a corporation's principal place of business for diversity purposes is its state of incorporation, which is Delaware. This means the court may not have personal jurisdiction based on the Hertz test.\n\nHowever, the problem also mentions that Quality Auto Parts manufactures $50 million worth of auto parts each year at its factory in Ohio and has 55% of its sales in Ohio. The Daimler decision suggests that general in personam jurisdiction will be proper in a corporation's state of incorporation and its principal place of business.\n\nIn this case, the court may consider the \"principal place of business\" concept for purposes of general in personam jurisdiction to mean the location where the most productive activity takes place (i.e., Ohio), rather than just the corporate headquarters. This is because the Daimler decision suggests that the concept of principal place of business may be different for personal jurisdiction.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The court would not have personal jurisdiction under the Hertz test, as Quality Auto Parts' corporate headquarters are in Indiana (Delaware). However, considering the \"principal place of business\" concept for general in personam jurisdiction might lead to a different result.\n\nB. This is the correct option. Given that Quality Auto Parts has significant connections with Ohio (manufacturing, sales, and damages), it is plausible that the court would exercise personal jurisdiction over Quality under the Daimler test for general in personam jurisdiction.\n\nC. The court does have subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity, but we don't know if it will also have personal jurisdiction.\n\nD.

The property-based jurisdiction (in rem) issue is whether Mitchell can have the Model T seized and attached in Oregon.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the attachment of the Model T would provide a valid basis for jurisdiction\nAccording to Pennoyer v. Neff, attachment provides an alternative means to satisfy claims when the defendant cannot be sued in personam. Since Neff has left his property (the Model T) in Oregon, Mitchell can obtain a writ of attachment and seize the vehicle.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the potential consequences of allowing the attachment of the Model T\nIf the court seizes the Model T and attaches it to satisfy Mitchell's claim, Neff is placed in a difficult position. He may lose his vehicle, which could be worth significantly less than the amount claimed ($20,000). Additionally, if Neff had already paid part or all of the fee, he may not be liable for the full amount.\n\nStep 4: Consider the legal principles that would guide Neff's response to Mitchell\nGiven the limited scope of in rem jurisdiction (i.e., only the attached property can be disposed of), the court cannot order Neff to pay the remaining balance ($20,000 - $6,000 = $14,000) if the Model T sells for less than that amount.\n\nStep 5: Identify the most appropriate course of action for Neff\nConsidering the above analysis, Neff should not resist or ignore the attachment process. Instead, he should appear and defend the underlying claim to ensure that he is not held liable for an amount greater than the value of his property.

She also gives notice by publication to unknown claimants to the property.\n\nIn this case, Ohora is seeking to adjudicate an unrelated claim to the property (quiet title action). The court would exercise quasi in rem jurisdiction over the Nebraska farm property.

The harm was suffered by Perrone, who is a resident of Acadia, but the harm was caused by Margules' actions while she was physically present in Montana.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is: **No**, the Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case (Option B).\n\n2. **Is it constitutional for the court to exercise jurisdiction if authorized by statute?**\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.

Next, we need to consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the bounds of due process for the court to assert jurisdiction over United Assurance in this case.

The principle does not apply in situations where the appellate decision creates new law or overrules a previous decision.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the Utah statute was correctly declared unconstitutional\nThe question states that the Utah court held the jurisdictional statute to be unconstitutional and dismissed McGee\u2019s case.

American Radiator, an act does not become a \"tortious act\" until the plaintiff suffers injury. In this case, Robertson's injury took place in Illinois. Since the dealership did not cause the injury directly in Illinois, but rather caused it when the car was driven into Illinois by Robertson, the question is whether Robertson's injury constitutes an injury within the state for purposes of the long-arm statute.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate each option\nOption A: The long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over Robertson's case, because Jackson's negligent act took place in Florida. This option incorrectly assumes that the location of the negligent act determines jurisdiction.\nOption B: The long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction in Robertson's case, but it would be unconstitutional for the court to require Jackson to defend this case in Illinois. This option correctly identifies that the statute would not offend due process, as Robertson's injury took place in Illinois.\n\nStep 6: Verify the correctness of each step\nUpon reviewing the steps and the relevant legal context, we can confirm that:\n\n- The long-arm statute in Illinois authorizes jurisdiction if the defendant commits a tortious act within the state.

        "reasoning step": "Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Understand the concept of a \"long-arm statute\" and its relationship with due process.\n\nA long-arm statute is a state law that authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who has committed certain acts in the state, even if those acts do not rise to the level of causing personal injury. The idea behind these statutes is to extend the reach of state courts beyond the traditional limits of due process.\n\nStep 2: Consider the problem with interpreting all long-arm statutes to \"go to the limits of due process.\"\n\nIf a court interprets a long-arm statute to mean that it goes to the limits of due process, it implies that anything constitutionally permissible is permissible. However, this would render specific provisions in the statute irrelevant, as they would be superseded by the broader requirement of constitutional compliance.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the given scenario involving Perrone and Margules.\n\nPerrone sues Margules in Acadia state court for defamation, claiming that Margules made false statements about his professional abilities. The long-arm statute in Acadia authorizes personal jurisdiction over defendants who \"cause personal injury in this state by a tortious act or omission while physically present within this state.\"\n\nStep 4: Consider the Acadia Supreme Court's statement that the long-arm statute goes to the limits of due process.\n\nIf the court interprets its long-arm statute as going to the limits of due process, it would imply that any act committed in Acadia could be considered a tortious act or omission within the scope of the statute. This would mean that Margules' actions, which occurred outside of Acadia and involved no personal injury, would still be subject to the jurisdiction of the Acadia court.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate each option based on the analysis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court's interpretation of its long-arm statute does not necessarily mean it has jurisdiction over Margules. The statue only authorizes personal jurisdiction if Perrone commits a tortious act in Acadia, which he did not do.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the statement that \"our long-arm statute goes to the limits of due process\" does not imply that Margules' actions would be considered a tortious act within the scope of the statute.\n\nOption C is correct because if the court interprets its long-arm statute as going to the limits of due process, it implies that any act committed in Acadia could be considered a tortious act or omission. However, Margules' actions occurred outside of Acadia and involved no personal injury, so it would exceed due process limits to exercise jurisdiction over Perrone.\n\nStep 6: Verify each step by re-reading the original text and question.\n\nThe answer is: C",

        "reasoning step": "Step 1: Understand the concept of \"going to the limits of due process\" in the context of long-arm statutes.\n\nAccording to the provided text, when a court says that its long-arm statute \"goes to the limits of due process,\" it means that the court will interpret the specific provisions of the statute as broadly as possible without overreaching constitutional bounds. This interpretation is key to understanding how courts apply this concept in practice.\n\nStep 2: Consider the meaning of \"limits of due process\" and its application to long-arm statutes.\n\nThe correct interpretation of \"going to the limits of due process\" does not mean that a court will take jurisdiction over any case that it constitutionally can. Instead, it involves considering whether there are provisions in the long-arm statute that might be interpreted one way (supporting jurisdiction) and another way (denying it). In such cases, the court should opt for the broadest interpretation consistent with due process constraints.\n\nStep 3: Apply this understanding to the provided scenario involving Ausable Motors Corporation and Lemmon's lawsuit.\n\nIn this case, Ausable manufactured motors in Louisiana, sold them to Sunday River Distributors in Kentucky, which then resold a substantial quantity of motors into Tennessee. Lemmon was injured by an Ausable motor while using it at Delta Retooling in Nashville, Tennessee. The question is whether the Tennessee long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction for this claim.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the options based on the correct understanding of \"going to the limits of due process.\"\n\nOption A suggests that the court will conclude Ausable is subject to personal jurisdiction under the \"transacting business\" provision because it would be constitutional. However, the correct interpretation of \"limits of due process\" does not guarantee jurisdiction if it is constitutionally permissible; rather, it involves a careful balance between interpreting the statute broadly and respecting constitutional limits.\n\nOption B suggests that the case will likely be dismissed for failure to satisfy the long-arm statute. Given that Ausable did sell motors in Tennessee, this provision could potentially allow jurisdiction.\n\nOption C implies that the case would be dismissed because exercising personal jurisdiction over Ausable would be unconstitutional. This interpretation is also not accurate given the correct understanding of \"limits of due process\" and its application in such cases.\n\nStep 5: Choose the most appropriate option based on legal reasoning and adherence to the provided context and analysis.\n\nBased on the steps above, Option B is the most appropriate choice because it accurately reflects the likely outcome under a proper interpretation of the Tennessee long-arm statute as \"going to the limits of due process.\" This means that courts will consider whether Ausable's actions within Tennessee fall within the provision allowing jurisdiction before deciding, rather than assuming that doing so would automatically be constitutional.\n\nThe answer is: B",

This indicates that Ito cannot appeal the court's ruling on jurisdiction at any point during the case.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options provided\nOption A states that Ito may not appeal the jurisdictional ruling because he waived his objection by raising it in the answer with other defenses on the merits.

However, a defendant can raise certain defenses to enforcing another state's judgment, including the defense that the court rendering the judgment lacked power or authority to do so.\n\nStep 4: Apply the relevant law to the scenario\nGiven Ito's argument that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him, this is one of the defenses he can raise in Acadia. The Acadia court will need to consider whether the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito and whether the Emporia judgment should be recognized under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct option\nBased on the analysis, if the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over Ito, it will not automatically enter a judgment on the Emporia judgment without considering Ito's defense.

As a result, Emporia enters a default judgment for Ervin.\n\nStep 2: Identify the key legal concepts involved in this scenario:\n- The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution states that each state must recognize and enforce judgments issued by other states.\n- Personal jurisdiction is one aspect of subject-matter jurisdiction, which determines whether a court can hear a case. A defendant may raise personal jurisdiction as a defense to an enforcement action.\n\nStep 3: Consider the legal principles regarding challenges to enforcing another state's judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause:\n- States are generally bound by the Full Faith and Credit Clause to recognize and enforce judgments from other states, but they do not automatically honor all judgments.\n- A defendant may raise certain defenses in an enforcement action, including that the court rendering the original judgment lacked personal jurisdiction over them.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the options provided in relation to legal principles identified:\n\nOption A suggests that Ito can raise both defenses (personal jurisdiction and fraud) in Acadia because he did not litigate them in Emporia. This aligns with the principle that a defendant can raise defenses in an enforcement action, including personal jurisdiction issues from the original judgment.\n\nOption B implies that the court will only hear the substantive defense to the fraud claim if it determines that the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction over Ito, which isn't necessarily correct given the general rule of Full Faith and Credit Clause and the ability to raise defenses in an enforcement action.\n\nOption C suggests that Ito cannot raise either defense because he waived them by defaulting in Emporia.

This means that he waived his right to raise this defense on appeal from the default judgment.\n2. Once a defendant defaults on the merits of an action, they lose their ability to relitigate issues of subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction that could have been raised by special appearance or objection at the outset of the case (if they had done so).\n3. Ito had defaulted on the merits in Emporia, which means he waived his right to appeal the court's decision on personal jurisdiction.\n4. When Ito seeks to enforce the default judgment in Acadia, he is effectively trying to relitigate issues that were already decided by the court in Emporia (i.e., whether there was personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin's claim).\n5.

Since we do not have information that Larry has authorized anyone to receive his process in this lawsuit, service on Larry may be improper.\n\n- Moe: The summons and complaint were delivered to Fields at his office in New York.

Rule 4(e)(2) states that service can be made on an individual defendant \"by delivering the summons and complaint to the defendant personally\" or by leaving them with someone of suitable age and discretion at their home. Since the papers were placed in front of West, it appears that she received notice.\n\nStep 4: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that service is:\n\n- Improper on Larry because no authorized agent was present.\n- Proper on Moe because Fields, presumably acting as an agent for Moe, could have been authorized to receive process (we need more information).\n- Proper on Curley because a person of suitable age and discretion was likely present when the summons and complaint were delivered.\n\nHowever, service by mail is also a valid method under Rule 4(e)(1), so if Curley did not consent to personal service but would have accepted it had he been present, it could still be considered proper. \n\n- Proper on West since she received notice of the summons and complaint.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.",

Venue is proper in a judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated.\n3. If there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, venue is proper in a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.\n\nIn this case, Dziezek sues Torruella and Hopkins for damages arising out of a business deal. The facts are:\n\n* Dziezek resides in the Southern District of Indiana.\n* Torruella resides in the Western District of Kentucky.\n* Hopkins resides in the Western District of Tennessee.\n* The negotiations between the parties took place in the Western District of Tennessee.\n* Dziezek commenced construction after receiving the first installment of financing, but the defendants refused to provide subsequent payments.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Venue is proper in the Western District of Kentucky (Torruella's residence). However, since all three defendants are not residents of the state where this district is located (Indiana), venue is not proper under option 1.\n\nB. Venue is proper in the Southern District of Indiana (Dziezek's residence). Again, since only one defendant (Hopkins) does not reside in the same state as this district (Tennessee), venue is not proper under option 1.\n\nC.

However, there is no substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim that occurred in this district, so option 2 does not apply.\n\nD. Venue would be proper in both the Western District of Kentucky and the Southern District of Indiana, but only one of these districts (the Southern District of Ohio) is not available as a venue choice under options 1 or 2.

These provisions state that:\n\n* Venue shall be proper in any judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the same state.\n* Venue shall also be proper in any judicial district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the residency of the defendants\nWe need to determine where Jackson and Sweda-Trak reside for venue purposes. According to the facts, Jackson has a time share in Aspen, Colorado, but the company is from Kansas. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jackson resides in Colorado or anywhere else.\n\nSweda-Trak is a Texas company with its only place of business in the Western District of Texas. This suggests that Sweda-Trak's principal place of business is in Texas, and therefore, it may be considered to reside there for venue purposes.\n\nStep 4: Apply the venue provisions\nBased on our analysis, we can see that:\n\n* Option B is incorrect because neither Jackson nor Sweda-Trak resides in Colorado.\n* Option C is correct because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place in California (where Chu was injured using the machine), but this option is not the best choice under the facts.\n\nLet's verify if there are any other options left. Given that we have already verified option B and C, we can now check option A. In Option A, it states that venue is proper in the Southern District of California (which includes Los Angeles) because property subject to the action is located there. However, this does not help us determine where Sweda-Trak resides, and we are trying to figure out if he has the requisite minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction.\n\nSince we have ruled out option B and can't verify the validity of option A, given that Sweda-Trak's place of business was in Texas (as stated), that gives us our final answer.

Now we need to check if Cleveland Manufacturing is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Illinois. If it is, then according to Section 1391(d), it would \"reside\" in the Southern District of Illinois.\n\n7. However, General Personal Jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction for a claim that arises anywhere and this will allow a defendant to be sued in any state in which they have contacts.

Since Cleveland Manufacturing's factory and principal place of business is located in the Northern District of Illinois, not in the Southern District of Illinois, option B is incorrect.\n\n9. According to section 1391(b)(2) a district shall be considered the venue for any civil action if any defendant has his principal place of business in that district, therefore, Cleveland Manufacturing's factory and principal place of business are located in the Northern District of Illinois which makes this venue proper under section 1391(b)(2).\n\n10.

The federal court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332.\n\nStep 2: Determine if there is personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\nConnors is a plaintiff from Texas, and he contacted Ace's Texas office to negotiate the contract. He also did the programming work for Ace's Texas operation at his home in Texas. Therefore, Connors has sufficient contacts with the Northern District of Texas to establish minimum contacts that would satisfy personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Determine if it is a proper venue.\nThe contract was negotiated by phone and e-mail from Connors' home in Texas, and he did the programming work for Ace's Texas operation at his home. Additionally, Ace has an office in the Northern District of Texas, where the contract was negotiated.

Laurel sues Fields for her injuries in state court, alleging joint and several liability, while Hardy sues Fields in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, also alleging joint and several liability. Fields argues that he is only severally liable for his percentage of fault.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Emporia Supreme Court's decision in Powers v. Hall (1911) and its application over the years.\n\nThe Emporia Supreme Court has held since 1911 that tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a plaintiff's full damages, even if another actor was also at fault in causing the injury. This rule has been applied numerous times, but there was a dissenting opinion from two justices in Sholto v. Dickens (1998).\n\nStep 3: Consider the Emporia Supreme Court's decision in Sholto v. Dickens (1998) and its potential impact.\n\nAlthough the majority ruled against changing to several liability, there was a vigorous dissent from two justices. Since then, one of the judges who was in the majority has left the bench and been replaced.

We must determine whether the federal court should follow the state's policy-based approach or apply its own no-fees policy.\n\nStep 3: Apply the legal principles from Byrd v. Blue Ridge to the Pocketbook Policies case.\n\nBased on Byrd, in matters of form and mode (such as litigation procedure), federal courts may consider the York policy of uniform outcomes alongside other policies, such as those affecting the integrity of the federal court system. However, this balancing act is only appropriate for issues related to procedural differences between state and federal law, not for substantive rights.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each option in light of Byrd v. Blue Ridge and the legal principles at play.\n\nOption A suggests that the federal court should follow the state statute unless it concludes that federal procedural interests outweigh the policy of uniform outcomes in state and federal courts. This approach aligns with the Byrd doctrine, as it recognizes the importance of uniform outcomes while also considering federal procedural interests.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it ignores the possibility of balancing federal interests against the York policy.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it incorrectly categorizes the issue as involving form and mode rather than substantive law.\n\nOption D is partially correct in stating that the amount of recovery does not affect whether the plaintiff will recover, but this option does not address the broader legal principles at play.\n\nStep 5: Select the most appropriate answer based on the analysis.\n\nThe answer is: A",

We need to determine which rules apply and how they interact.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the problem**\n\nBased on the context, this is a modified outcome-determination problem under Part I of Hanna v. Plumer (1968), which deals with conflicts between state law and federal judicial practice. In contrast, Part II of Hanna addresses conflicts between state law and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the relevant rules**\n\nAccording to the Rules Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a)), Congress has delegated the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to the Supreme Court. The second subsection, however, bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that abridge, enlarge, or modify substantive rights (28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b)).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the options**\n\nGiven the rules and context:\n\nA. Admitting evidence is a matter of trial procedure, which is not directly relevant to the conflict between state law and federal judicial practice.\n\nB. Classifying the question as \"rationally capable of classification\" (as procedural) is irrelevant in this context, where we have a clear conflict between state law and federal judicial practice.\n\nC. The statement about the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law is too broad and does not directly address the issue at hand.\n\nD. Excluding evidence that would be admitted under Emporia statute due to forum shopping concerns is not relevant, as we are focused on resolving the conflict between state law and federal judicial practice.\n\nE. Admitting evidence that would be excluded in state court (due to the Emporia statute) because it leads to forum shopping is still not directly addressing the issue of how the federal judge should decide under Part I of Hanna.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Hanna Part I**\n\nGiven the conflict between Emporia law and federal judicial practice, we need to apply the modified outcome-determinative test (Part I of Hanna). The key question is whether the court had the power to write the relevant Federal Rule. Since there is no applicable Federal Rule in this case, we must decide whether admitting the evidence would be a decision that could lead to a different outcome than Emporia law.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\n\nThe correct answer is E. Admitting the evidence because doing so would not lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws.

The problem involves a federal district court deciding to apply an equitable remedy (equitable laches) instead of a state statute of limitations.\n2. We need to classify the problem as either a modified outcome-determination problem under Hanna Part I or a Rules Enabling Act problem under Hanna Part II.\n3. In this case, the conflict is between state law (statute of limitations) and a federal equitable remedy (equitable laches), which is not embodied in a Federal Rule.\n4. Therefore, we are dealing with a conflict involving a state substantive right (statute of limitations) and a federal judicial practice (equitable laches).\n5. According to the modified outcome-determinative test in Hanna Part I, the court must decide whether the federal remedy would lead to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain under state law.\n6. However, the Hanna Part II analysis is relevant because we need to determine whether the Court had the power to adopt the equitable laches doctrine as a federal rule of civil procedure.\n7. The Supreme Court's decision in Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2010) suggests that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b), which prohibits modifying substantive rights.\n8. Since the federal court is applying an equitable remedy, which is a judicial process for justly administering remedies and redress for disregard or infraction of rights (Hanna Part II test), we must determine if the Court had the power to adopt such a rule.\n9. As the Supreme Court has not held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b) and Shady Grove suggests that the Court would rarely strike down valid federal law, we can assume that the federal court's decision is valid.\n10. Therefore, the federal district court's decision to apply equitable laches should be affirmed.\n\n\nThe answer is: D.",

A \"direct collision\" refers to a situation where the federal rule directly conflicts with a state procedural provision.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option A**:\n   - **Does it address the scenario?**: No, it does not consider the specific issue of whether serving the summons after filing would satisfy the state limitations period.\n   \n4. **Analyzing Option B**:\n   - **Does it apply relevant legal principles?**: Yes, it suggests that since Congress could enact this provision under its authority, the federal court should apply its own rule regarding when an action is commenced for purposes of satisfying a statute of limitations.\n   - **Is it applicable to the scenario?**: Yes, because if Congress had the power to enact this provision, and assuming it was rational and capable of classification as procedural, then the federal court should apply its rule.\n\n5. **Analyzing Option C**:\n   - **Does it address the problem?**: No, it suggests applying the state approach based on a potential for forum shopping or inequitable administration, which is not directly relevant to determining if there's a direct conflict between the two rules in question.\n   \n6. **Analyzing Option D**:\n   - **Does it consider the definition of a \"direct conflict\"?**: No, it jumps to applying the state approach without addressing whether there indeed is a direct conflict between the federal rule and the state statute.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The best option to address the specific scenario is **B**, as it correctly identifies that the provision falls under Congress's authority and thus should be applied by the federal court, even though it doesn't explicitly state \"there's a direct collision,\" which isn't necessary for this part of the problem (the Hanna Part I analysis).

Plumer, the Supreme Court established that Congress has the power to promulgate rules governing procedure in the federal courts, as granted by the Rules Enabling Act.\n\nStep 3: Identify the issue at hand - Sanchez's suit against Bernstein for fraud is brought two years and five months after the alleged fraud was committed, which exceeds the FDLA's two-year limitations period.\n\nStep 4: Apply the legal principle to the scenario - The Supreme Court in Hanna v. Plumer ruled that Congress can delegate rule-making power to the federal courts if it is \"rationally capable of classification as either\" substance or procedure. In this case, the FDLA's limitation on the time for filing diversity cases could be seen as regulating procedure (time-sensitive practice) rather than a substantive right.\n\nStep 5: Consider the potential implications - If Congress can enact statutes that affect the outcome of litigation, even if they impinge on state law rights that can reasonably be classified as \"substantive,\" it could lead to abuse of power and undermine the balance between federal judicial authority and state sovereignty.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the options - Option A suggests dismissing the claim under the FDLA unless it would \"abridge, enlarge or modify\" a substantive right.

However, this rule is limited in that the defending party can only bring in a person who may be responsible to reimburse it for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the scenario presented in the example.\n\nIn the example, Firenze sues Smith for injuries suffered in a fire in Smith's apartment building.

This is in accordance with Section 1367(a) of the federal statutes, which states that all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within the original jurisdiction can be heard.\n\n2. **Original Jurisdiction**: The scenario establishes that Jilbert sues Pope and Vaughan based on diversity jurisdiction for $90,000 in damages caused by faulty yard work.

Here, both Pope's contribution claim against Vaughan and his mower claim against him are related to the main claim of Jilbert's suit (founding suit) since they are connected in the same legal case.\n\n5. **Determining Jurisdiction**: The Kroger case (also known as Kroger v.

If the same claim could have been asserted by Cavers as a standalone suit without diversity issues (i.e., no need for supplemental jurisdiction), then it does not qualify for supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate whether Cavers can assert this claim against Newcomb in federal court based on these steps.\n\nSince there is original jurisdiction over the main claim and it was brought by a plaintiff who is making Newcomb into the case under Rule 14(a), we must determine if the claim falls within an exception to supplemental jurisdiction. Given that Newcomb is being joined as a defendant (in essence, made a party of in this suit) in Cavers' original suit seeking damages under federal law, the court has already determined it has jurisdiction over him.\n\nStep 6: Conclusion based on analysis\n\nGiven that the claim against Newcomb was brought by a plaintiff who already had federal court before them and was joined under Rule 14(a), which is explicitly listed as an exception in \u00a71367(b) for claims brought by plaintiffs (as opposed to defendants), the court does have jurisdiction over this aspect of the case. However, it must assess whether the federal claim has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim. Since Cavers' main claim under the ADEA is a standalone suit that could be pursued without diversity or supplemental jurisdiction issues, there is no need for the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is: B",

Ortega counterclaims for patent infringement, based on the company\u2019s decision to market a device on which he claimed to hold a patent.

In this case, there is a connection between the claims against Ortega and the counterclaim regarding breach of contract.

First, we need to understand the rules of supplemental jurisdiction as outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367. There are two parts: \u00a71367(a) and \u00a71367(b).\n\n2. Section 1367(a) allows the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that is arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as another claim that is within the court's original jurisdiction. In this case, Cavers' breach of contract claim against Pariah Corporation is within the court's original jurisdiction because it is a diversity claim.\n\n3. Section 1367(b) prohibits the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs who are not parties to the original action if doing so would violate the requirements of original jurisdiction (e.g., amount in controversy). This means that if Westford were asserting his own independent claim against Pariah Corporation, and his damages were not already included in Cavers' $100,000 damage claim, then the court would be barred by \u00a71367(b).\n\n4. Given these rules, let's examine each option:\n\n   Option A: Have jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s claim under \u00a71367(a), but it is barred by \u00a71367(b). This cannot be correct because if the court were to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a71367(a) and had jurisdiction over Westford's claims under Cavers\u2019 original breach of contract claim, then it would already violate the amount in controversy requirement for Westford\u2019s independent claim.\n\n   Option B: Not have jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s claim under \u00a71367(a). This is correct because Westford does not meet the amount in controversy requirement as an independent plaintiff. His damages are part of Cavers\u2019 $100,000 damage claim, so exercising supplemental jurisdiction would violate the amount in controversy requirement for Westford.\n\n   Option C: Have supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under \u00a71367(a) and it would not be barred by \u00a71367(b). This cannot be correct because the court does not have jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s independent claim due to insufficient damages (it is part of Cavers\u2019 original $100,000 damage claim).\n\n   Option D: Have jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s claim under \u00a71367(a), but his claim is barred because it is inconsistent with the diversity requirements of \u00a71332, since it does not meet the amount in controversy requirement.

This notice should be brief and not require each element to be specifically alleged.\n\nStep 3: Consider the Conley v. Gibson standard\nThe Conley v. Gibson standard states that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of their claim that would entitle them to relief. This means that if the court could imagine facts consistent with the pleading that would establish a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights, the complaint should not be dismissed.\n\nStep 4: Apply the Conley v. Gibson standard to the example\nIn the example provided, Dahlal sues Curley for damages after being fired from his city job three weeks after Curley took office.

The Supreme Court's decisions in Bell v. Twombly (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009) have set a higher pleading standard for plaintiffs.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the pleading standards after Bell v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal.\nThe Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs must plead specific facts to support their claims, not just alleged or inferred facts. The complaint must demonstrate plausibility, meaning it must be possible that the defendant's conduct was based on a protected class (in this case, Danou's Iraqi origin).\n\nStep 4: Examine the options provided.\nOption A suggests that if the plaintiff had alleged in the complaint that a loan officer at the bank had stated that it was refusing the extension because Danou was Iraqi, the court would have assumed the truth of that allegation. However, this approach contradicts the heightened pleading standard set by Bell v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal.\n\nOption B states that as long as the plaintiff alleged each element of a cause of action for discrimination based on ethnic origin, the Sixth Circuit would reverse the dismissal. While it is true that discrimination claims require alleging specific elements, this option does not address the plausibility requirement established by Bell v. Twombly and Ashcroft v. Iqbal.\n\nOption C suggests that the complaint does not contain factual allegations making it plausible that the bank's decision was based on Danou's Iraqi origin, unless Danou needs to develop his evidence of discrimination through discovery from the defendants. This option correctly captures the essence of the plausibility requirement established by Bell v. Twombly and Ashcroft v.

This rule allows a plaintiff to assert multiple versions of their claim with evidentiary support.\n\nStep 3: Break down the given scenario: Giscard sues Munson and Bigby, alleging that construction work on Munson's property has altered drainage on Giscard's lot, causing damage (Option A). He seeks damages from both for past interference and an injunction against future interference (involving regrading their properties).\n\nStep 4: Determine if the allegations are inconsistent. In one count, Giscard claims Munson caused the damage, while in another, he claims Bigby is responsible for the same issue.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the consistency of the type of relief sought. For both counts (Munson and Bigby), Giscard seeks damages for past interference, which might be considered consistent since it's about past harm.

Initially, Pope files a complaint seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability.\n\nLater, at a discovery conference, Pope remembers what is basic black letter law in his state regarding conscious misuse as a defense or reduction in recovery under comparative negligence. He moves to amend the complaint to assert a second claim for relief, alleging that Adventure was negligent in designing the vehicle with too narrow a wheelbase.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Deny the amendment because it would add an additional theory of recovery, rather than changing the theory asserted in the initial complaint.\n\nReasoning: This option is incorrect because Rule 15(a)(2) states that the court should \"freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\" The amendment seeks to change the legal claims rather than the factual allegations. It's not just about adding a new theory of recovery but also about allowing the party to adjust their legal position based on new information or changed circumstances.\n\nB. Deny the amendment, if she concludes that Pope should have thought of this theory when he filed the initial complaint.\n\nReasoning: This option is incorrect because the rule doesn't require the party to anticipate every possible theory of recovery at the time they file the complaint. The rule allows for amendments based on evolving understanding of the case, not just on hindsight.\n\nC. Deny the amendment, because Jhala can still proceed on a strict products liability theory, and may recover on this ground.\n\nReasoning: This option is incorrect because it focuses on whether Jhala has an existing claim under the initial complaint, rather than considering the potential benefits of amending the complaint to reflect new legal knowledge or changed circumstances. The amendment could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for Jhala, even if he initially only had a strict products liability theory.\n\nD. Allow the amendment, because it facilitates a decision on the merits, even if Jhala's counsel should have asserted it in the initial complaint.\n\nReasoning: This option is correct because Rule 15(a)(2) encourages judges to freely grant amendments when justice requires it, especially as trial approaches and parties are refining their theories. Allowing Pope to amend the complaint would facilitate a more informed decision on the merits of Jhala's case, even if he didn't initially consider this theory.\n\nThe answer is: D",

This is within the three-year limitations period.\n\nStep 2: Four months later, Roberts moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted fraud, another claim with a three-year limitations period.\n\nStep 3: Rule 15(c)(1)(B) states that an amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading if it asserts a claim or defense arising out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out in (or attempted to be set out in) the original pleading. In this case, both claims arise from the same underlying events (the sale of men's suits on March 15, 2013).\n\nStep 4: Since the amended fraud claim arises from the same underlying events as the original breach of contract claim, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) allows the amendment to relate back to the date of the original filing, which is March 1, 2016.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016. This means that Morales should still have notice of this claim within the limitations period, just like he did for the breach of contract claim.\n\nOptions Analysis:\n\nA. The statement that \"The amendment will not relate back under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).

This option incorrectly suggests that the dress claim would relate back to March 1, 2016, based on breach of contract, rather than relating back to the date when Roberts initially filed his complaint (March 1, 2016). The correct application of Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is based on the conduct or transaction set out in the original pleading.\n\nC. This option incorrectly suggests that the dress claim would relate back to June 15, 2016, the date when the limitations period for the dress claim would have run.

The statement that \"The amendment will not relate back under Fed. R. Civ.

He files suit before the three-year limitations period passes. Later, he wants to add a fraud claim, which also has a three-year limitations period.\n\nStep 3: Apply Rule 15(c)(1) to Roberts' situation\nAccording to the rule, if the amended claim arises out of the same conduct or transaction as the original pleading, it will be treated as though it had been filed on the date of the original pleading. In this case, both the contract and fraud claims arise from the sale of men's suits on March 15, 2013.\n\nStep 4: Determine if Roberts' amended claim relates back\nYes, according to Rule 15(c)(1), Roberts' amended claim for fraud will relate back to the date of his original pleading (March 1, 2016).\n\nStep 5: Analyze the situation with Harcourt and the City\nHarcourt sues the City for breach of contract in February 2016.

The court considered this under Rule 15(b), which allows amendments when parties have implicitly or explicitly litigated issues outside the pleadings.\n\nStep 2: Identify relevant rules and principles\nRule 15(b)(1) permits amendment when a party objects at trial that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings. However, if the court determines that the objecting party did not understand that an issue was being litigated or if the parties have not impliedly tried the issue in question, the court may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the facts of the scenario\nIn this case, Adventure Vehicles, Inc. seeks to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk. The parties have presented evidence on several issues related to Jhala's accident with the ORV, including speed and slope.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the parties impliedly tried the issue of assumption of the risk\nAdventure presents evidence about Jhala's route, speed, and slope at the time of the accident. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues, indicating that they have been trying the issue of comparative negligence, which is closely related to assumption of the risk.\n\nStep 5: Apply Rule 15(b)(1) principles\nSince Adventure has presented evidence supporting an assumption-of-risk defense and Jhala has also introduced relevant evidence, it can be inferred that both parties have impliedly tried this issue.

To answer this, we need to carefully read Rule 11(a) and (b).\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option against Rule 11\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption A: A lawyer makes a legal argument in a telephone conversation with opposing counsel for which she has no supporting legal authority.\nRule 11 does not specifically address verbal arguments, so this option may not be relevant to Rule 11.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Option B\nOption B: A lawyer fails to answer a set of interrogatories propounded to her client by the opposing party.\nRule 11 does not directly address responses to interrogatories or failure to answer them. Therefore, this option is unlikely to trigger sanctions under Rule 11.\n\nStep 5: Analyze Option C\nOption C: A lawyer sends a letter to opposing counsel demanding damages for medical expenses which his client alleges she incurred, but actually did not.\nThis option involves making a false claim in an argument or letter. This aligns with the purpose of Rule 11, as it aims to prevent frivolous or abusive arguments from being presented to the court.\n\nStep 6: Analyze Option D\nOption D: A lawyer files a complaint seeking damages for medical expenses her client claims to have suffered, without seeking any evidence from the client that she incurred those expenses.\nWhile this option involves making a false claim, it is not an argument or statement in support of a legal position.

Hu's counsel is seeking damages for emotional distress as a bystander in a case where the West Dakota Supreme Court had previously held that such recovery is not allowed (Smith v. Chang).\n\nStep 4: Analyze option A. According to this option, Hu's counsel has violated Rule 11(b)(2) because the Smith decision refused to recognize such a right for bystanders and has never been overruled.\n\nVerification: In order for an argument to be considered frivolous under Rule 11(b)(2), it must have been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction. Since Hu's counsel is arguing for a change in law, not relying on an established precedent, this option may be incorrect.\n\nStep 5: Analyze option B. According to this option, Hu's counsel has violated Rule 11(b)(2) because the trial judge in the Bubbles case had ruled that the right does not exist, just two years earlier.\n\nVerification: A ruling by a lower court is not binding on higher courts, and it is possible that another trial judge in West Dakota would recognize the right for bystander emotional distress. Therefore, this option may be incorrect.\n\nStep 6: Analyze option C. According to this option, Hu's counsel has not violated Rule 11(b)(2) because he has the right to argue for a change in the law and another trial judge in West Dakota would not be bound to follow the trial judge's holding in Bubbles.\n\nVerification: This option is consistent with the analysis of rule 11(b)(2). Since Hu's counsel is arguing for a change in law, it is permissible for him to present his argument. Additionally, courts should not prevent advocates from presenting reasoned persuasive arguments that challenge established law, so long as they are based on nonfrivolous grounds.\n\nStep 7: Analyze option D.

First, we need to understand what Rule 11(b)(3) states: \"An affidavit or a certificate of service that asserts there is a good faith belief that the allegations and attachments are warranted by existing evidence\" (emphasis added). This suggests that the purpose of this rule is to prevent lawyers from making unfounded claims in their pleadings.\n\n2. Next, we examine the example given in the question: Smithers comes into Garcia's law office, breathless and angry, and asks her to represent her in suing her employer, Acme Corporation.

She claims that she was making $100,000 a year and is now unemployed.\n\n3. We then learn that after minimal discovery, it turns out that none of the facts Smithers related (other than that she was fired) are true. This means that Garcia's complaint contained factual allegations that were not supported by evidence.\n\n4. Now, we need to apply Rule 11(b)(3).

In this case, Garcia's complaint contains allegations that were not supported by evidence.

Specifically, it highlights the difference between repeat performance (Rule 12(g)(2)) and waiver of disfavored defenses (Rule 12(h)).\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Rule 12(g)(2)\nRule 12(g)(2) bars repeat pre-answer motions, usually, which means that if a defendant makes a motion under this rule, they cannot make another one about the same issue unless there is an extraordinary circumstance. This rule is intended to prevent frivolous or repetitive motions from tying up time and resources in the legal process.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing Rule 12(h)\nRule 12(h), on the other hand, provides that if a defendant does not timely raise certain defenses (personal jurisdiction, venue, sufficiency of process, and sufficiency of service of process), they will be considered to have waived those defenses. These defenses are considered \"disfavored\" because they can often be asserted in a motion under Rule 12(b).\n\nStep 4: Examining the scenario\nIn the given scenario, LaFleur makes two motions: one to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3) (personal jurisdiction) and another under Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim). The court denies the first motion but does not make an immediate decision on the second motion.\n\nStep 5: Applying the rules\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that LaFleur's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper because it relates to a defense that was available when he made his first motion (Rule 12(b)(3)). This would be considered a repeat performance under Rule 12(g)(2), and as such, it cannot be raised in a second pre-answer motion. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nThe answer is: A",

The court denies the motion.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the two subparts of Rule 12(h)(1).\n\nRule 12(h)(1)(A) applies where the defendant had made a pre-answer motion, and it provides that if the defendant left one of the four disfavored defenses (objections to personal jurisdiction, venue, sufficiency of process, and insufficient service of process) out of that motion, she has waived that defense.\n\nRule 12(h)(1)(B) applies where no pre-answer motion was made, and it provides that if the defendant answers, without including one of the disfavored defenses, that the omitted defense is waived as well (unless added by a motion to amend the answer as a matter of course under Rule 15(a)).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether Able's situation falls under Rule 12(h)(1)(A) or Rule 12(h)(1)(B).\n\nSince Able's original motion was a Rule 12(b)(6) objection, which is not one of the disfavored defenses, it does not fall under Rule 12(h)(1)(A). Therefore, we need to analyze this situation under Rule 12(h)(1)(B).\n\nStep 4: Analyze whether Able waived his objections.\n\nAble's original motion was a Rule 12(b)(6) objection, which did not include the defense that venue is improper. Since no pre-answer motion was made for the venue defense, and Able answered without including it in his answer, he has waived this defense under Rule 12(h)(1)(B).\n\nHowever, Able included the release defense in his answer, so he did not waive that defense.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct option based on the analysis.\n\nThe answer is: B",

However, since the defense of improper venue was not raised at all, there's no basis for these motions.\n\n5. **Option B suggests a motion for judgment on the pleadings**, but this is typically used when there's an admission by a party that allows the opposing party to move for judgment as a matter of law.

However, this does not change the timing for asserting such an objection.\nStep 3:  Understand that the federal courts follow a similar approach to raising pre-answer defenses like lack of personal jurisdiction as seen in state courts using the special appearance rule, but they also provide more flexibility with their Rule 12(b) motion.\nStep 4:  Note that both federal and some states allow for combining objections under Federal Rule 12 in a single answer or motion.

If a defendant raises any other issue, they are deemed to have waived their objection to personal jurisdiction. In contrast, under Rule 12(b), a defendant can raise objections to personal jurisdiction in their first response to the complaint (pre-answer motion or answer) and may assert other pre-answer defenses.\n\nStep 3: Examine the given scenarios\nScenario A states that Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction because he did not include it in his notice of removal, which is incorrect. The waiver only occurs if Hue had already litigated issues outside of the jurisdictional issue before answering the complaint.\nScenario B states that Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction because he answered on the merits as well as raising Rule 12(b) objections in his answer, which might be true but we need to check other options for correctness. \nScenario C states that Hue\u2019s objection to personal jurisdiction is properly raised in his answer, which seems correct given that he has now asserted an objection to personal jurisdiction as required by rule.\nScenario D states that Hue's objection to personal jurisdiction is waived because the state court from which it was removed applies the special appearance rule. This option appears incorrect since we know that in federal courts objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by rule, not a special appearance.\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct answer\nGiven the analysis above, we can conclude that the correct answer is C.

R. Civ. P.). The rule governs the scope of discovery through various devices such as depositions, interrogatories, and productions of documents. It dictates what information parties can obtain during the discovery process.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant factors for the scope of discovery\nThe rule considers several factors in determining the scope of discovery, including:\n- Relevance to any party's claim or defense\n- Proportionality to the needs of the case\n- Importance of the issues at stake in the action\n- Amount in controversy\n- Parties' relative access to relevant information\n- Parties' resources\n- Burden and expense of proposed discovery compared to its likely benefit\n\nStep 3: Analyze the situation presented in the question\nKarim sues Precision Machine Company for a serious injury sustained using one of their machines, which was manufactured with negligent design. The statute of limitations on a strict products liability claim has expired.\n\nStep 4: Determine if information sought is within the scope of discovery under the current standard (2000 amendment)\nThe rule currently states that parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case. The 2000 amendment added \"considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources\" as factors.\n\nStep 5: Apply these factors to the given situation\nGiven Karim's claim for negligence and Precision's manufacturing defect, information related to the safety measures taken after her injury is considered. The fact that such measures are not admissible in evidence under the relevant rules of evidence (subsequent remedial measures) does not preclude discovery if it is \"relevant to a claim or defense.\"\n\nStep 6: Evaluate each answer choice\n- A. Incorrect, because evidence of subsequent remedial actions may be discoverable despite being inadmissible at trial.\n- B. Incorrect, as the issue revolves around relevance rather than temporal order (before and after Karim's injury).\n- C. Incorrect, because under the current amendment, information relevant to a claim or defense is within scope regardless of the earlier standard that excluded such matters.\n- D.

D asks P an interrogatory seeking the names of all other sexual partners P had during the six-month period when she must have contracted the disease. P resists on the basis that the request unduly intrudes on her privacy.\n\nStep 1: The discovery sought by D is personal and arguably intrusive (names of sexual partners). Under Rule 26(b)(1), such information may be limited if it is deemed too burdensome or unduly intrusive.\nStep 2: The court's discretion in limiting discovery allows for the protection of a party's privacy, especially when the request is for personal, potentially sensitive information.\nStep 3: Therefore, it is least likely that the court would order D to provide this requested information.\n\nCase B: P sues D, who has only $10,000 in auto liability insurance, for $100,000. P seeks discovery of D's financial assets, in order to determine whether it is worth prosecuting the action to judgment. D resists on the ground that the information is not within the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).\n\nStep 1: The discovery sought by P (D's financial assets) may be relevant to a case involving economic damages and value.\nStep 2: However, Rule 26(b)(1) allows for limitations on discovery if it is deemed too burdensome or not material.\nStep 3: In this case, the information sought is certainly relevant but may also impose a heavy burden (obtaining detailed financial records).\nStep 4: Therefore, it is likely that the court will limit D's discovery request.\n\nCase C: P sues D, claiming that it discharged her in violation of her contract, to save money, because she was making more money than D's other managers. She seeks discovery of the salaries of all other managers in the company. D resists on ground that the information is confidential and will invade the privacy of the other managers.\n\nStep 1: The information sought by P (salaries of other managers) may be relevant to determining whether the employer violated a contract.\nStep 2: However, similar to Case B, obtaining detailed salary records could be burdensome for D.\nStep 3: Under Rule 26(b)(1), discovery can be limited if it is deemed too burdensome or not material.\nStep 4: Therefore, it is likely that the court will limit P's discovery request.\n\nCase D: P brings a products liability action against D, a car manufacturer, based on failure of the brakes on a 2010 van made by D. P seeks all reports from dealers concerning brake problems on vans of that model sold between 2005 and 2010. D resists the request on the ground that it is too burdensome because complaints are not segregated by the type of complaint, and it sold 125,000 vans of that model during the requested period.\n\nStep 1: The discovery sought by P (all reports from dealers concerning brake problems) may be relevant to assessing liability in a products liability case.\nStep 2: However, obtaining detailed information from D about all complaints related to brake issues across 125,000 vehicles for five years could be extremely burdensome and time-consuming.\nStep 3: Under Rule 26(b)(1), discovery can be limited if it is deemed too burdensome or not material.\nStep 4: Therefore, the court is likely to limit D's discovery request.\n\nCase E: P, a prisoner, sues the Department of Corrections for deprivation of his constitutional rights under the First Amendment, claiming the Department promulgated a policy requiring prisoners to shave their beards. P argues that the policy is based on hostility to his religion, which requires him to wear a beard. P suffered no monetary damages, but seeks nominal damages of $1 and an injunction ordering the warden to change the policy. P seeks all written complaints by prisoners at his facility over a five-year period that assert the deprivation of rights of religious expression. D resists production on the ground that it is too burdensome in light of the monetary value of the case.\n\nStep 1: The information sought by P (all written complaints regarding religious freedom) may be relevant to assessing D's actions and motivations.\nStep 2: However, obtaining detailed records from D about all such complaints could be burdensome and time-consuming, especially since there were no monetary damages claimed in this case.\nStep 3: Under Rule 26(b)(1), discovery can be limited if it is deemed too burdensome or not material.\n\nThe answer is: E",

Three months after these initial disclosures were exchanged, counsel for Xifares discovered an itemization of construction expenses that had been misfiled with forms from another project and was missed by Xifares' employees.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Rule 26(e)(1) to determine when a party must supplement its disclosure\nAccording to the rule, if a party learns in some material respect that their initial disclosure is incomplete or incorrect and the additional information has not already been disclosed during discovery, then they must supplement the disclosure in a timely manner.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Xifares' actions\nXifares did not disclose the itemization immediately when it was discovered. This occurred six months after initial disclosures were exchanged and three months before the trial date. Therefore, this delay may impact the timeliness of the supplementation.\n\nStep 5: Determine the appropriate course of action based on the analysis\nConsidering that Rule 26(e)(1) requires a party to supplement their disclosure \"in a timely manner,\" if Xifares failed to disclose the itemization within the specified time frame (three months before trial), they may face potential consequences. However, this rule does not automatically bar the use of the information at trial unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the provided options\nOption A suggests that Xifares did not violate Rule 26(a)(1)(A) because its employees made a reasonable search for relevant documents before making initial disclosures. This option does not address the issue of supplementation.\nOption B proposes that Xifares will be barred from using the itemization at trial, as it should have been in the initial disclosure. However, this ignores the rule's specific language regarding the need to supplement \"in a timely manner.\"\nOption C suggests that the judge must bar Xifares from using the itemization at trial because they did not supplement their disclosure \"in a timely manner.\" This aligns with the requirements of Rule 26(e)(1).\nOption D indicates that Xifares violated its disclosure obligations but will not necessarily face consequences. This option also misinterprets the timing requirement.\n\nStep 7: Select the appropriate answer based on the analysis\nBased on the legal context and the evaluation of the options, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is: C",

General Engines Corporation, the manufacturer of the engines involved in the crash, has been served with interrogatories requesting them to list all reports and investigations related to accidents involving their engines over the last ten years, as well as the names of the persons conducting those investigations.\n\nStep 2: Review Rule 33(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nRule 33(a)(2) states that an interrogatory is proper, but a party may be allowed to defer answering it until discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Additionally, the court may order a party to not answer an interrogatory if it relates to opinions or contentions.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the nature of the interrogatory requested by Atmosphere Aviation\nThe interrogatory asked by Atmosphere Aviation requests information that is not readily available within Branch's own files (i.e., documents in offices at other corporate locations). To obtain this information, General Engines would need to conduct a reasonable investigation.\n\nStep 4: Determine if General Engines has a duty to investigate and answer the interrogatories\nRule 33(b)(1)(B) states that when responding to interrogatories, a party must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the requested information. In this case, Branch should not just list what she knows in her own files but instead conduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has.\n\nStep 5: Review the options\nOption A is correct because it involves conducting a reasonable investigation to gather all relevant documents and answer based on that investigation.\nOption B is incorrect because it only lists documents from Branch's own files, which may not include information in other corporate locations.\nOption C is incorrect because Rule 26(a)(1)(B) deals with disclosures required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which are different from interrogatories under Rule 33.\nOption D is also incorrect as General Engines can object to an answer only if it's beyond discovery.\n\nThe answer is: A",

        "reasoning step": "Step 1: Analyze the request for production of documents under Rule 34.\n\nThe Request for Production of Documents seeks \"all documents relating to the drafting, negotiation, or execution of the contract in issue in this litigation.\" This is a broad request that seeks all documents related to the contract, which could include numerous types of documents such as drafts, correspondence, and meeting minutes.\n\nStep 2: Determine if Paragon has already produced the document.\n\nParagon's officers have already searched for documents responsive to the request and identified one troubling document - a memo written by Paragon's contracts administrator. The memo details her discussions with Omniplex negotiators regarding the meaning of a clause in the contract that requires Paragon to supply Omniplex's needs for wiring assemblies.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the relevance of the memo under Rule 34.\n\nRule 34(b)(1)(A) states that a request must describe documents sought with \"reasonable particularity.\" However, this requirement only applies to the categories of documents sought. It does not prohibit parties from seeking specific documents within those categories.\n\nStep 4: Determine if Paragon should produce the memo as part of the broad request for production of documents under Rule 34.\n\nIn light of the memo's relevance to the contract in issue and its potential significance in the litigation, it is likely that the court will find the request for production of documents under Rule 34 to be too broad. Therefore, Paragon should not produce the memo as part of the broad request.\n\nStep 5: Consider alternative options\n\nOption B suggests that Paragon describe the document as required by Rule 26(b)(5), but raise the work product objection to avoid producing it. While Rule 26(b)(5) does allow parties to seek documents that are not formally privileged, this does not necessarily mean that they can be produced under a broad request for production of documents.\n\nOption D suggests that Paragon need not produce the document because it simply states an opinion as to the meaning of the disputed term in the contract. While the memo may contain opinions and conclusions, its relevance to the contract in issue makes it potentially relevant to the litigation.\n\nStep 6: Choose the correct option\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most appropriate course of action for Paragon is to interpret the Rule 34 request narrowly and not produce the document. This approach ensures that the memo is not produced as part of a broader request that may be deemed too vague or overbroad.\n\nThe answer is: C",

This is relevant because Rule 34(b)(1)(E) allows a party to comply with a Rule 34 request by producing the relevant documents as kept in the usual course of business.\nOption B - records at Advanced Testing are not present in Arizona, and therefore are not subject to the jurisdiction of the court.

Two months after filing suit, Czonka's counsel learns that Roh, one of his supervisors, has just retired and will be moving to South Korea.\n\nStep 2: Understand the purpose of a deposition\nThe purpose of a deposition is to preview the detailed testimony of witnesses, get them on the record, and allow deposing counsel to learn what they know and ask follow-up questions. In this scenario, NorthStar has already noticed Roh's deposition, which means Roh is being deposed.\n\nStep 3: Consider the timing of discovery\nDiscovery has just begun for Czonka's case, which means there is limited time to prepare for a deposition. The court may view an early deposition as premature and potentially disruptive to the discovery process.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the options\n\nA. Preparing for the deposition as if it were at trial may be overly aggressive given that discovery has just begun. This approach could lead to an unfair or burdensome situation for Czonka's counsel.\n\nB. Objecting and moving for a protective order under Rule 26(c) is appropriate in this scenario.

P. 50(a) asks the judge to take the case away from the jury if there is \"no legally sufficient evidentiary basis\" for a plaintiff's claim.\n\n2. **Considering the Elements of a Negligence Claim**: In a negligence case, four elements must be established: duty, breach, damages, and causation.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Plaintiff's Evidence**: The plaintiff presents evidence showing that she suffered from arm pain, was treated by Dr. Vicaro with various drugs, and her condition worsened, resulting in significant damage to her job due to the loss of use of her arm.\n\n4. **Determining if the Plaintiff Has Met Her Burden of Production**: To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must show that she has met her burden of production by providing enough evidence for a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, to find in her favor on each element of her claim. In this scenario, the plaintiff's evidence suggests a breach of duty (she was treated with drugs), damages (her arm is significantly damaged), and potentially causation (her condition worsened after treatment). However, the key issue revolves around whether she has established a duty to provide proper care.\n\n5. **Assessing Option A**: The motion should be denied because if the jury believes the plaintiff's evidence, they can conclude she is disabled and find for her on damages and causation. This option suggests that the judge's decision should not preempt the jury from considering the case, which aligns with legal principles regarding the burden of proof and the role of juries.\n\n6. **Assessing Option B**: The motion cannot be made before the plaintiff has presented all evidence, as this would violate the principle that a party should have the opportunity to present their case fully before any judgments are rendered.\n\n7. **Assessing Option C**: This option is incorrect because it assumes the plaintiff could not establish relief for a negligence claim based solely on the information given (which does not specify whether she established the duty aspect of her negligence claim).\n\n8. **Assessing Option D**: This option states that the motion can only be made after the jury deliberates, which is incorrect under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a), as motions for judgment as a matter of law can be made at any time before or during trial.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is: A",

The evidence presented at trial includes:\n\n1. A bystander's testimony that the car was a red Chevrolet with license plate numbers \"3\" and \"1\" and that the driver was a blonde woman.\n2. Evidence that Sills lives three blocks from the scene of the accident, owns a red Chevrolet with those same license plate numbers, and often commutes home along Maple Street in the early evening.\n3. Sills testifying that she was home cooking dinner at the time of the accident and that her car was in her garage.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The judge should grant the motion only if she concludes that Sills is telling the truth.\n\n- **Verification:** This option is incorrect because the judge is not supposed to determine the credibility of witnesses or evaluate the truthfulness of their testimony when deciding whether the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict (Simblest v. Maynard, 427 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1970)). The judge must assume that the jury will construe the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party.\n\nB. The judge should grant the motion for Sills. She has given direct testimony that it was not her that hit Pavarotti, and Pavarotti's evidence is based on inferences from circumstantial evidence.\n\n- **Verification:** This option is incorrect because the judge is supposed to take the case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff (Pavarotti) and assume that the jury will resolve conflicts in the testimony in favor of the plaintiff. The judge must also consider whether there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict, without weighing the credibility of witnesses or considering the weight of the evidence.\n\nC. The judge should grant the motion, since the evidence does not clearly establish that it was Sills who hit Pavarotti.\n\n- **Verification:** This option is correct because, based on the provided context, the evidence presented by Pavarotti primarily relies on circumstantial evidence (e.g., license plate numbers and testimony about a blonde woman driving a red Chevrolet). The judge should consider whether there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict, assuming that the jury will construe the evidence in favor of Sills. If the evidence is insufficient for a jury to reach a rational verdict for Pavarotti on each element, the judge may grant Sills' motion.\n\nD. The judge should deny the motion. The evidence is sufficient to support an inference that Sills was the driver, and the judge in passing on the motion would disregard Sills' testimony that she was not driving.\n\n- **Verification:** This option is incorrect because the judge must assume that the jury will believe Sills' witnesses, even if their testimony is impeached or contradicted by Pavarotti's evidence. The judge should not disregard Sills' direct testimony about her whereabouts at the time of the accident.\n\n**The answer is: C.**",

She submits a program from her performance and a review from the Miami Herald to support her testimony.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the defendant's evidence is unimpeached or contradicted.\nThe bystander's testimony describes the car as a red Chevrolet with license plate numbers \"3\" and \"1\" and that the driver was a blonde woman. There is no indication in the text that this testimony is impeached.\n\nStep 4: Apply the appropriate standard for determining if there is sufficient evidence to support Pavarotti's case.\nSince Sills' testimony directly contradicts the eyewitnesses' description of the car (Sills owns a red Chevrolet with license plate number 74J-311), and also because her unimpeached testimony about being in Miami at the time of the accident, it would be reasonable for a jury to disbelieve. The defendant's evidence supports an inference that Sills was not driving. Therefore, the appropriate standard is the \"plaintiff's evidence\" standard.\n\nStep 5: Determine if there is sufficient evidence to support Pavarotti's case under the \"plaintiff's evidence\" standard.\nUnder this standard, the judge only looks at the evidence that supports the plaintiff's case and disregards any evidence for the defendant. The evidence that supports Sills' claim of being in Miami does not contradict or directly relate to her driving status; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support Pavarotti's case.\n\nStep 6: Determine the correct option.\nThe correct answer is A, as under the \"plaintiff's evidence\" standard, the judge would deny the motion.\n\nThe answer is: A",

First, the party must have made a prior motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury (Rule 50(a)). Second, that prior motion must have been denied or an appropriate ruling made by the court.\n\nStep 3: Now let's examine the facts in the problem. Uberoth sues Colon, alleging fraud and seeking damages. The two motions for judgment as a matter of law are discussed below:\n\n- First Motion:\nColon moves to dismiss before the case goes to the jury on the ground that Uberoth has not presented enough evidence to support a finding of liability. This is the first motion under Rule 50(a). \n\nStep 4: Since this was the first time Colon has made such a motion, it satisfies the second condition for filing a renewed motion under Rule 50(b).\n\nStep 5: Now let's move on to the renewed motion:\n\n- Renewed Motion:\nColon argues that Uberoth presented no evidence of reliance on his misrepresentation. However, in denying the prior motion, the court did not rule on this issue, but rather stated that Uberoth had produced enough evidence for a jury to decide.\n\nStep 6: The first condition is satisfied since Colon has made the renewal within twenty-eight days of entry of judgment and the second condition is also met since the prior motion was denied by the judge.

The question is about motions for judgment as a matter of law in a judge-tried case, where the judge is finding the facts.\n\nStep 2: Recall that Federal Rules 50(a) and (b) do not apply to judge-tried cases, which means there are no rules governing this specific situation.\n\nStep 3: Understand that in a jury trial, motions for judgment as a matter of law allow the judge to control the jury's role. However, in a judge-tried case, where the judge is also finding the facts, these motions serve to prevent the judge from deciding against a party without sufficient evidence.\n\nStep 4: The correct standard to apply in a motion for judgment as a matter of law in a judge-tried case is not the burden of proof, but rather the burden of production. This means that the plaintiff must have introduced sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict on their claim.\n\nStep 5: Option A states that Colon has invoked the wrong standard by arguing that Uberoth failed to meet his burden of proof, which in this context would mean a burden of proof, not a burden of production.\n\nStep 6: The judge's role is to evaluate the evidence presented and decide whether it is sufficient to support a rational verdict. If the judge finds that Uberoth has met the burden of production, she should deny the motion.\n\nStep 7: Option B states that Colon has invoked the proper standard if the judge concludes that Uberoth has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Colon knew the statements were false. This is correct because the burden of production in this context means that Uberoth must have introduced sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict.\n\nStep 8: Option C states that the judge should enter a finding that Colon did not make the statements knowing them to be false and proceed to hear the rest of the case if she concludes that Uberoth has not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Colon knew the statements were false. This is incorrect because in this context, the judge does not need to find for the defendant on an issue before proceeding with the trial.\n\nStep 9: Option D states that Colon has invoked the proper standard but would have to make the motion at the close of all the evidence. While it is true that motions for judgment as a matter of law can be made at any time, in this context, the correct standard to apply is the burden of production, not the burden of proof.\n\nConclusion: The answer is B.",

During trial, evidence of three other assaults by Keller on arrestees is admitted without objection from Keller's counsel. The jury returns a verdict finding Keller liable.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Motion:** Four days after judgment is entered for Hazak, Keller's counsel moves to overturn this judgment based on the grounds that the evidence of other assaults should have been excluded due to lack of relevance and potential bias in its admission. This motion is brought under Rule 59, which allows for a new trial if errors of law occurred during the first trial.\n\n3. **Applying Legal Principles:** \n    - **Rule 59(a)** states that after judgment on the verdict, either party may move for a new trial to correct errors in procedure.\n    - The court should grant the motion unless it determines that: (1) no error was committed; or (2) prejudicial error did not affect the verdict.\n\n4. **Determining the Applicability of Rule 59:** Since the motion is made after judgment and under Rule 59, we must assess whether the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of other assaults without objection from Keller's counsel.\n\n5. **Evaluating the Motion's Merits:**\n    - The key issue here is not whether the verdict might have been different with or without this evidence (the \"suspicion of possible prejudice\" aspect of Rule 59), but rather if a legal error was committed in admitting such evidence.\n    - Given that the motion for a new trial is made after judgment, it cannot be based on the jury's decision being influenced by the improperly admitted evidence, as this would involve issues of appellate review under Rule 60(b).\n    - Instead, the focus should be on whether the trial judge committed an error in admitting the evidence.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The primary concern is whether there was a legal error in admitting the evidence that could potentially impact the outcome of the case based on procedural rather than substantive law.

The court typically denies the motion if the evidence should have been discovered earlier if the moving party's counsel had been diligent in preparing for trial. This means that Sardinha must show that he could not have found this evidence before the first trial.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the FAA manual was reasonably available to Sardinha's counsel at the time of the first trial. There is no indication that Sardinha's counsel had access to the FAA manual, or that they would have been diligent in finding it if they had looked. The fact that Sardinha only discovered the manual after the first trial suggests that it was not reasonably available.\n\nStep 4: Consider Lindbergh's testimony.

In the second action, Aronson sues Miller again for negligence, claiming that Miller's employees were negligent in interpreting the contract specifications and built the addition one hundred square feet smaller than the plans required.\n4. To determine whether Aronson's second suit will be barred, we need to examine whether it is based on the same \"transaction\" as the first action.\n\nAccording to the Second Restatement approach, a party is held to waive any claims they leave out of the first action if they arise from the same transaction. In this case, both actions involve the construction of Aronson's house and the alleged breach of contract (first action) or negligence related to that construction project (second action).\n\nStep 1: Identify the underlying facts:\n- Both actions involve the construction of Aronson's house.\n- The construction was allegedly done in breach of contract specifications.\n\nStep 2: Determine if both actions arise from the same \"transaction\":\nYes, they do. The first action involved a breach of contract claim related to the construction project, while the second action involves a negligence claim also related to the construction project.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe answer is: C",

        "reasoning step": "The second action asserted by the Town of Jasper against Montrose Paving Company includes a negligence claim for destruction of trees and shrubs caused when Montrose brought in its large paving machine to do the transfer station paving job, as well as a refund of advance payments made to Montrose on a contract to pave the school parking lot, which Montrose had contracted to complete before the transfer station job, but had never performed.\n\nStep 1: Determine if both claims are related to the same \"transaction\" under the Second Restatement approach. The Town's first action against Montrose involved a breach of contract claim for paving the roadway and parking areas at its transfer station, which resulted in damages that necessitated hiring another contractor to redo the job. The second action involves two separate claims: (1) negligence arising from destruction of trees and shrubs caused by Montrose's use of its large paving machine during the transfer station paving job, and (2) a refund for advance payments made on a contract to pave the school parking lot.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate whether the claims in the second action arise out of the same transaction as that in the first action. The transfer station paving job is a distinct event from the school parking lot project. Although both projects were undertaken by Montrose, they involve different facts and were not necessarily performed simultaneously. Thus, these two separate actions do not relate to the same \"transaction\" under the Second Restatement approach.\n\nStep 3: Apply this analysis to determine which claims will be barred, if any. Since the negligence claim arises from a distinct event (the transfer station paving job), it is not barred by res judicata based on the first action against Montrose. However, the Town's refund claim for advance payments made on a contract to pave the school parking lot also relates to a separate transaction (the school parking lot project). Therefore, this second claim will be barred by res judicata.\n\nStep 4: Compare the above analysis with the options provided and determine which option best fits the legal reasoning.\n\nBased on the Second Restatement approach applied in Step 1-3, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is: C",

Akbar sues Rajiv Motors for injuries suffered while driving a used snowmobile, and his suit is based on breach of warranty (a contract theory) and strict products liability (a tort theory). Rajiv moves to dismiss the contracts claim because the Emporia long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over it.\n\nStep 2: The court grants Rajiv's motion to dismiss the contract claim, but allows Akbar to proceed with the strict liability claim. After Akbar presents evidence, the trial judge grants a directed verdict for Rajiv on the ground that Akbar has not presented sufficient evidence that the snowmobile was defective.\n\nStep 3: The question asks whether Akbar's second action for the same injuries is barred by res judicata. To determine this, we need to consider whether the first action was rendered on the merits of the case and whether there was a final decision on the merits in the first action.\n\nStep 4: In the first action, Rajiv moved to dismiss the contract claim due to lack of jurisdiction. This motion did not decide the merits of the case because it only concerned the court's jurisdiction over the contract claim, rather than the substantive issue of breach of warranty. Therefore, the dismissal of the contract claim was not a final decision on the merits.\n\nStep 5: In the first action, Akbar presented evidence in support of his strict liability claim, which was allowed to proceed. The trial judge then granted a directed verdict for Rajiv on this claim, but the directed verdict was based on a lack of evidence rather than a determination that Akbar failed to prove his case.\n\nStep 6: In determining whether Akbar's second action is barred by res judicata, we need to consider whether he had an opportunity to litigate the negligence theory in the first action. The problem states that Akbar omitted bringing a negligence claim in the first action.\n\nStep 7: Since Akbar did not have an opportunity to litigate his negligence theory in the first action, and it could have been brought in the first action but was omitted, the principles of res judicata apply.\n\nConclusion:\nThe answer is: A",

The first lawsuit dealt with damages to the roof, while Conductrol Products, Inc.'s claim was related to the damage caused by water leaking from the roof to its stored products.\n\nStep 3: Identify if privity exists between the parties in both suits.\nPrivity is a legal concept that refers to the relationship between an individual and another party when one person has acted on behalf of another. In this case, there is no indication that Conductrol Products, Inc., or Regal Property Management, had a privity relationship with Granite State Crane Company.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the nonparty (Conductrol) could have joined as a co-plaintiff in Regal's suit.\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a), a person who is so affiliated with or interested in a subject of litigation that they could substantially be affected by the judgment is a necessary party and must be joined if \"in personam jurisdiction is possible.\" However, Conductrol chose not to join as co-plaintiff in Regal's suit.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the legal principles applicable to this scenario.\nThe res judicata principle states that a judgment entered in one lawsuit bars a subsequent action by the same parties or those who share an \"in interest\" relationship with them. \n\nStep 6: Determine the outcome based on the analysis above.\nSince Conductrol did not join as co-plaintiff, and there is no indication of privity or shared interests between the parties, the judgment in Regal's suit does not bar Conductrol from bringing a separate action against Granite State Crane Company for damages to its stored products. \n\nTherefore, The answer is: D.",

        "reasoning step": "The problem requires analyzing whether Collins can argue that Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute applies in his second lawsuit against Mora, considering collateral estoppel.\n\nStep 1: Determine what issue was decided in the earlier lawsuit. In the first case in Virginia, the judge concluded that Mora had never accepted the contract, which means she did not meet the 'contracting to supply' provision of the Virginia long-arm statute. The court also found that none of the negotiations took place in Virginia, so the claim did not arise out of the transaction of business by Mora in Virginia.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the issue in the second action is the same as the one decided in the first case. In Collins' second lawsuit against Mora in Maryland, Collins argues that both provisions of Maryland's long-arm statute apply - 'contracting to supply' and 'transacting business.' This argument is related to the issue decided in the first case (whether a contract was formed or not) rather than whether the transactions were conducted in Virginia.\n\nStep 3: Apply the concept of collateral estoppel. Assuming that DeVito raised collateral estoppel as a defense in the second action, the court would likely estop Collins from asserting misrepresentation as a defense to the second action because the first case already resolved this issue. However, Collins is not arguing about misrepresentation; he is trying to argue that Mora's transactions were conducted under Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute.\n\nStep 4: Assess whether collateral estoppel applies in this scenario. In general, the court will apply the same result from a prior suit as it did when litigating that suit in the first instance - and if not litigating it at all; or to the same issue of law or fact. Here, Collins is arguing about Mora\u2019s conduct under Maryland's long-arm statute (transacting business), which was already decided upon by a judge in his prior case against DeVito.\n\nStep 5: Consider whether there are any differences between the current action and the previous one that could affect the application of collateral estoppel. In the first case, Collins sues Mora for misrepresentation in Virginia; in this second lawsuit, Collins tries to assert jurisdiction based on Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute against Mora. Since these issues were not resolved in the prior court's decision (the issue was about contract acceptance), there is no basis to hold Collins from asserting the 'transacting business' provision.\n\nConclusion: Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that Collins will likely not be estopped from arguing that Maryland\u2019s long-arm statute applies. The key point here is that Collins is using a different legal theory (Mora transacted business in Maryland) which was already decided upon by the court in his prior case against DeVito.\n\n\nThe answer is: B",

The issue decided was Gillespie's negligence, specifically that he did not run a red light.\n\n2. **Determine if the issue in the second action is the same as the one decided in the first**: In the second action, Renfrow raises two arguments: (1) Gillespie ran the red light and (2) Gillespie swerved into Renfrow's car rather than swerving to avoid it. The key question is whether these issues are the same as the issue decided in the prior action.\n\n   - The first argument, that Gillespie ran the red light, is the same issue decided in the prior action. \n   - However, the second argument, regarding Gillespie's swerving, was not fully litigated in the first action (as it was not mentioned by Renfrow). Therefore, this issue was not resolved in the prior lawsuit.\n\n3. **Apply the collateral estoppel principle**: Collateral estoppel applies to issues that were \"thoroughly\" litigated and decided in a prior lawsuit. Issues that were not fully litigated do not fall within the scope of collateral estoppel.\n\n4. **Evaluate each option**:\n   - A: Renfrow will be barred from asserting either of these arguments to establish the defense that Gillespie was negligent. This option is incorrect because Gillespie ran a red light, which was decided in the prior action.\n   - B: Renfrow will be barred from asserting the red light argument, but not the negligent swerving argument. This option is partially correct, as Renfrow cannot assert the first argument (red light), but can assert the second (swerving).\n   - C: Renfrow will not be barred from asserting either of these arguments, since they were not fully litigated in the first action. This option is incorrect because Gillespie ran a red light was decided in the prior action.\n   - D: Renfrow will not be barred from raising either argument, because this action is a new suit in which Renfrow asserts Gillespie's negligence as a defense, not to establish liability.

In the first lawsuit (Suit One), Watkins sues Pasquale for her injuries and Pasquale denies negligence, pleading that Watkins was negligent in causing the accident. The jury renders a general verdict finding that Pasquale is not liable to Watkins.\n\n2. For collateral estoppel to apply, two conditions must be met: \n   a) The issue decided must have been raised in the first lawsuit\n   b) The party seeking collateral estoppel (Pasquale) must show that the first lawsuit's decision on this specific issue precludes him from litigating it again.\n\n3. In Suit One, both parties presented evidence on two negligence issues: Watkins' negligence and Pasquale's negligence. However, the jury did not render a verdict on one of these issues (Watkins' negligence) because the general verdict only found that Pasquale was not liable for Watkins' injuries without providing specific findings.\n\n4. The issue is that we do not know whether the jury decided Watkins was negligent or not since they only declared Pasquale not liable, leaving open the possibility that Watkins was negligent but could have been compensated nonetheless.\n\n5. According to the \"actually decided\" element of collateral estoppel, if a fact finder (judge or jury) heard evidence on an issue and resolved it in one party's favor, there is no point in doing so again. If they did not decide the issue, however, collateral estoppel cannot apply.\n\n6. Given that the jury in Suit One only decided Pasquale was not liable for Watkins' injuries (i.e., declared Watkins took nothing), but left open whether Watkins was negligent or not, we can't definitively determine which party is subject to collateral estoppel yet.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the logic of \"actually decided,\" it's clear that Pasquale cannot invoke collateral estoppel to establish both negligence issues because he did not have his first lawsuit's decision on one of those issues, namely Watkins' negligence.\n\n8.
