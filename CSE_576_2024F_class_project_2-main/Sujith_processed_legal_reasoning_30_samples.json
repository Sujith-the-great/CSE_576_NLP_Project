The state citizenship of a person\u2014as opposed to that of a corporation\u2014is determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The \u2018\u2018residence\u2019\u2019 requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish \u2018\u2018residence\u2019\u2019 in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don\u2019t have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there \u2018\u2018indefinitely,\u2019\u2019 that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her \u2018\u2018home.\u2019\u2019 She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn\u2019t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn\u2019t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn\u2019t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn\u2019t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite \u2018\u2018indefinite\u2019\u2019 intent",
            "question": "Marla, who grew up in Montana, moved to Colorado after high school to enter a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. She wasn\u2019t sure if she really wanted to be a stylist, but she was anxious to get away from home, and her parents agreed to foot the bill, so off she went. She figured she\u2019d stay if she liked it, and get a job as a stylist afterwards, in Denver or elsewhere in the West (including Montana). Or she would leave the program if she didn\u2019t like it and look for work, hopefully in Denver. She took an apartment on a six-month lease. After moving to Denver, Marla",
            "options": "A. remains domiciled in Montana, because the program is only for two years. B. remains domiciled in Montana, because she may return there to work as a stylist.  C. remains domiciled in Montana, because she was domiciled there before she left for Denver.  D. is domiciled in Colorado, because she resides there with the intent to remain indefinitely.",
            "ground_truth": "Don\u2019t be fooled by A. Although Marla\u2019s program is for two years, that doesn\u2019t mean that Marla will be there only for two years. The question indicates that she might stay in Denver after finishing the program, or she might leave for a job in some other Western state. Or, she might leave the program if she doesn\u2019t like it and stay in Denver. Thus, she may leave Colorado, or she may not. Since she is not definitely planning to leave Colorado at the end of the program, her stay is not clearly limited to the two years of her academic program. How about B? It sounds seductively reasonable. But the test for domicile isn\u2019t whether you might someday go back to the state from which you came. The test is your attitude toward the state where you are. If you live in a state indefinitely, you acquire a domicile there, even if you think you might go somewhere else, or back where you came from, at some point in the future. Here, Marla\u2019s state of mind is that, whether she finishes the program or not, she may stay in Colorado, or she may leave. That certainly does not show an intent to leave at a definite time. She is in the state with no definite plans to leave. The possibility that Marla might move on at some time in the future does not make her current stay a \u2018\u2018definite\u2019\u2019 one. She might leave Colorado, or she might not. That\u2019s \u2018\u2018indefinite\u2019\u2019 intent. C would only be right if Marla has not established a new domicile in Colorado. If she went to Denver for a fixed period, she would retain her Montana domicile. However, if she\u2019s in Denver without definite plans to leave, she establishes a new domicile there. The facts suggest that her stay is open-ended, so she has established a Colorado domicile. D takes the prize.",

This is the essential message of that civil procedure chestnut, Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908). In Mottley, the plaintiffs sued the railroad for breach of contract, and alleged in their complaint that the railroad had breached the contract because it believed that a federal statute prohibited it from renewing their passes for free travel. In fact, when it answered the complaint, the railroad did rely on the federal statute as their justification for denying the passes. The parties then litigated that federal question and the federal trial court held that the federal statute did not bar renewing the passes. The United States Supreme Court reversed and ordered the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that a case only \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law, within the meaning of the federal statute granting arising-under jurisdiction, if the plaintiff relies on federal law as the source of her right to relief. That wasn\u2019t true in Mottley: the plaintiffs had sued for breach of contract, a state law claim. Although a federal issue was litigated, because the railroad raised a defense based on federal law, the plaintiffs did not base their claim on federal law. The fundamental premise of the Mottley rule is that we must assess the federal court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction based on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. There is no inherent reason why this must be so. Presumably, the court could wait to see whether the defendant\u2019s answer raises defenses based on federal law, or asserts a counterclaim under federal law, and allow the court to hear the case if she does. Such later pleadings may inject important federal issues into the case, as they did in Mottley. There\u2019s a good argument that this would be a sensible interpretation of the arising-under statute. Indeed, the American Law Institute recommended some years ago that removal be authorized where the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a federal law defense. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, \u00a71312(a)(2) (1969). But Mottley is still a good law in the federal courts. Here\u2019s a fairly straightforward question that illustrates the point.",

The suit is brought in federal court, and alleges that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated was using watered-down concrete on a federal construction project. Garces answers, admitting that he had made a report to the agency, but alleging that his report was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right of free speech. He also files a counterclaim against Consolidated, based on the Federal Whistleblower Act, which authorizes damages for anyone who is dismissed or disciplined for reporting fraud on the federal government. After answering the complaint, Garces moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Assume that there is no jurisdiction based on diversity.) The motion should be",

E. denied, because Garces waived his objection to jurisdiction by answering the complaint and asserting a counterclaim against Consolidated.",
            "ground_truth": "While it might make sense to allow federal jurisdiction whenever an issue of federal law is raised in a suit, this has not been the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the arising-under statute. Under Mottley, we don\u2019t consider federal questions injected into the case by the defendant. Consequently, C is wrong; the fact that the case involves a federal question isn\u2019t enough to satisfy Mottley. We need to look at the plaintiff\u2019s claim only. Here, the law that creates Consolidated\u2019s right to sue is libel law, which is state tort law; the federal law issue only enters the case as a defense. D is wrong for the same reason. Just as we don\u2019t consider federal defenses raised in the answer, we don\u2019t consider counterclaims (that is, claims for relief asserted by the defendant against the plaintiff) in assessing arising-under jurisdiction. One irony here is that Garces could just as well have been the plaintiff in this dispute. Both parties had claims against the other. If Garces had filed suit first, his claim under the Federal Whistleblower Act would have supported federal arising-under jurisdiction. But he didn\u2019t file first, and under Mottley the court will only consider Consolidated\u2019s claim in assessing its jurisdiction. Consequently, Garces will end up litigating his federal law defense and counterclaim in state court. A is the correct answer. When I test this issue, I always like to have one choice in which there\u2019s a vague federal presence that is not directly the source of the claims in the action. Here, B is wrong because the fact that the report was made to a federal agency doesn\u2019t mean that Consolidated\u2019s claim arises under federal law. There\u2019s a vague federal flavor here, but if we ask what Consolidated is suing Garces for, the answer is, for libel, a claim arising under state law. Under Mottley, such peripheral involvement of federal law will not suffice to support jurisdiction. See, however, Section C below, which illustrates a situation in which a federal issue embedded in a state claim may support jurisdiction. E is emphatically wrong, because an objection to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the case. If the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it must dismiss, even if the defendant wants the court to hear it, asserts her defenses and counterclaims, and proceeds to litigate there. Mottley, in which the parties litigated to judgment in the trial court and appealed, illustrates the point. Although the parties wanted the Court to reach the merits, it dismissed because the federal trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case.",

The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71441(a) provides that \u2018\u2018any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, \u00a72? If not, it can\u2019t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here\u2019s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.",

Pollux answers the complaint, admitting that he refused to deliver the drug, and offering as an affirmative defense that he learned, after making the contract, that the drug was covered by a patent, so that, under federal patent law, he could not manufacture it without a license to do so.

The action is not properly removed, because the case does not \u2018\u2018arise under\u2019\u2019 federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.",
            "ground_truth": "The third choice, C, is particularly illogical. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71441(a), cases may be removed to federal court if they are within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts. Cases arising under federal law are within the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction, so they, like diversity cases, may be removed under \u00a71441(a). The other three options are closer. A appears to rest on the premise that a case may be removed whenever it is clear that a federal issue will be litigated in the action. But that isn\u2019t the standard under \u00a71441(a); under that section, the case can only be removed if it could have been filed originally in federal court. As we belabored in the previous chapter, many cases that involve federal law cannot be filed in federal court. Witness poor Erasmus and Annie Mottley\u2019s case. The test for removal is whether the plaintiff could have filed the case initially in federal court, not whether some federal issue is likely to arise or has arisen in the action. This case could not have been filed in federal court, for the same reason that the Mottleys\u2019 action was thrown out by the Supreme Court: it arises under state contract law. There\u2019s a difference between this example and Mottley, however. Here, at the time of removal, the defendant had actually asserted the federal defense in his answer. Thus, the federal issue is already in the case; there is no need to speculate as to whether a federal issue will be litigated in the action. However, this does not change the result. The removal statute provides that only cases that could have been filed originally in federal court may be removed. Castor could not have filed this action in federal court, because it arises under state law and the parties are not diverse. So, the terms of the removal statute itself bar removal here. A is wrong. This point is the key to B as well. It is true that this case arises under federal law within the meaning of Article III, \u00a72, as expounded by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn. Pollux has injected a \u2018\u2018federal ingredient\u2019\u2019 into the case by raising a federal defense. But under \u00a71441(a) the case may only be removed if it could have been filed in federal court. And we know that to file a case in federal court, it must not only fall within the scope of the Article III grant, but must also be conveyed to the federal district court by statute. Castor\u2019s case is within the Article III grant, but it is not within the statutory grant of arising-under jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Under Mottley, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint must rely on federal law as the source of his right to relief, to \u2018\u2018arise under\u2019\u2019 federal law within the meaning of \u00a71331. The court will not look at the defendant\u2019s answer in determining whether the claim arises under federal law. So the case could not have been brought in federal court initially, and therefore cannot be removed. D is the winner.",

D. has jurisdiction over Neff for the fees claim, but would not have jurisdiction over him if Mitchell had sued him for a claim that arose in another state.",
            "ground_truth": "This question makes the basic point about Pennoyer: that jurisdiction was acquired by the symbolic act of in-state service of process, and that once in-state service was made, the court acquired the power to adjudicate the case for which process was served. The distractors reflect various misconceptions about this principle. C suggests that, for the court to litigate the case, the defendant must not only have been served with process in the state, but remain in the state while the case proceeded. Not so. The logic of Pennoyer was that a defendant within the state was subject to the sheriff\u2019s (and the court\u2019s) power to arrest. Under early English practice, the local sheriff may actually have arrested the defendant and held her pending resolution of the case, or at least had the power to do so. Later, actual arrest of the defendant gave way to symbolic seizure, through personal delivery of the court papers in the suit. However, the premise was that this symbolic seizure subjected the defendant to the court\u2019s authority, not just at the moment of service, but on an ongoing basis. The court\u2019s power, once properly asserted by service of process within the forum state, continued throughout the litigation. Neff could leave after he was served if he wanted, but that would not prevent the court from proceeding with the case once it had acquired jurisdiction. B fails as well. It suggests that Neff could only be subjected to jurisdiction through in-state service if he was in the state for some reason connected to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. But the logic of Pennoyer was that a defendant present within the forum state was subject to the authority of that state\u2019s courts, without regard to why he was there. Jurisdiction was based on symbolic arrest, not on any relationship between Neff\u2019s reason for being in Oregon and the lawsuit. He could be there to play the lottery, to visit the zoo, or to be inaugurated as governor; it wouldn\u2019t matter. His presence when served was the key, not the reason for that presence. D also comes up short. It suggests that jurisdiction could be based on service of process in the state, but that the court would only acquire jurisdiction by in-state service to adjudicate claims that arose within the state. This is another misconception. If Mitchell filed suit in Oregon, and served Neff with the papers for that suit in Oregon, it didn\u2019t matter what the claim was for. It could be for an auto accident in Maine, a property dispute in Texas, or lies told about him in Minnesota. Jurisdiction was not based on any relation between the claim and the state; it was based on the premise that the court could exert judicial power over a person physically present there. (After all, if Neff never came back to Oregon, Mitchell would have to sue him in California under Pennoyer\u2019s approach, and the California court would then exercise jurisdiction over Neff, even though the claim Mitchell sued upon arose in Oregon.) So A is the winner. If Mitchell managed to serve Neff with the papers initiating the suit in Oregon, under Pennoyer the Oregon court obtained jurisdiction over Neff for that suit, and leaving wouldn\u2019t deprive the court of authority to proceed. Once jurisdiction attached, it continued, even though the sheriff, after \u2018\u2018catching\u2019\u2019 Neff in the state, let him go.",

            "ground_truth": "In A, jurisdiction is not based on general in personam jurisdiction. Indeed, it is not based on in personam jurisdiction at all. It is an exercise of in rem jurisdiction, based not on bringing the defendant before the court, but upon the seizure of his property by attachment to satisfy an unrelated claim. More on this later in the chapter. Note too, that the defendant in this case is an individual. General in personam jurisdiction based on extensive contacts (as opposed to domicile) may not apply to individual defendants at all, but only to corporations. See Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 610 n.1 (1990). B involves an exercise of specific in personam jurisdiction. Surely, selling a few cars a year in New Mexico is insufficient to support general in personam jurisdiction, which rests on the premise that the defendant conducts continuous, extensive activity in the forum state. However, Truscott\u2019s claim here arises out of a minimum contact of Mancini in New Mexico: advertising the car there and subsequently selling it to Truscott there. This would support specific in personam jurisdiction, since Truscott\u2019s claim arises out of a sale actively solicited by Mancini in New Mexico. D is also a specific in personam case. Here, Cartwright sues for a claim that arises out of sales of Skilful\u2019s products into Michigan. Even after Asahi and McIntyre, Skilful would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Michigan for this claim since Skilful directly cultivated the Michigan market for its products by selling saws in quantity in Michigan, and Cartwright\u2019s claim arises from a product sold into Michigan. But Skilful\u2019s contacts would almost certainly not support general in personam jurisdiction in Michigan. In Daimler A.G. v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the Supreme Court held that a corporation is only subject to general in personam jurisdiction in states where it is \u2018\u2018at home.\u2019\u2019 In almost all cases, Daimler held, a corporation is \u2018\u2018at home\u2019\u2019 only in the state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business. Michigan probably does not meet that test, even though Skilful does a lot of business there. Nor would Cartwright need to invoke general in personam jurisdiction, since the claim arises out of a Skilful contact in the forum. C is different. Here, Truscott sues Mancini in Texas for a claim that arose from its activity in California. Mancini has plenty of contacts in Texas, but this claim does not arise from them. If the court is to exercise jurisdiction in the case, it will have to do so based on the fact that Mancini, which is incorporated in Texas and has a permanent place of business there, has extensive contacts in Texas that support general in personam jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over any claim against the corporation, even if it arose in another state.

            "context": "Let\u2019s start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court\u2019s power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property \u2018\u2018without due process of law,\u2019\u2019 that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it\u2019s a court that\u2019s doing the depriving\u2014by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it\u2014basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have \u2018\u2018a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being \u2018\u2018at home\u2019\u2019 in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That\u2019s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (\u2018\u2018No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u2019\u2019) It says to the states, \u2018\u2018go ahead, define your courts\u2019 jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don\u2019t overreach.\u2019\u2019 It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority.

First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant.

            "ground_truth": "It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to narrow down the choices here. The statute requires that the defendant, when she commits the tortious act, be physically present in Acadia. Margules wasn\u2019t, so the statute does not authorize the Acadia court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Margules. That eliminates A right off the bat. B asserts that the statute does not authorize the court to hear the case, and that, if it did, it would exceed constitutional bounds to exercise jurisdiction over Margules on these facts. This is almost certainly not so. Margules deliberately reached into Acadia to cause a substantial adverse effect on Perrone in Acadia, and did. A person need not physically enter a state to establish a minimum contact there that will support personal jurisdiction over her. She need only purposely engage in conduct focused on the state that she can foresee might cause adverse effects there and lead to litigation there. Margules certainly did that, and it would not be unreasonable to require her to defend this Acadia-focused act in Acadia. Compare Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984) (Florida defendant who wrote defamatory article about California actress published there subject to personal jurisdiction in California, even if he did not travel to California in connection with the article). How about D, which suggests that the court can exercise jurisdiction because Margules\u2019s minimum contacts in Acadia would constitutionally allow the court to do so? This dangerously misconstrues the relation of jurisdictional statutes and constitutional constraints. Although it would be consistent with due process for Acadia to require Margules to defend this case in Acadia, it has chosen not to require him to. Instead, it has written a long-arm statute that does not \u2018\u2018reach to the limits of due process.\u2019\u2019 In this long-arm provision, Acadia has granted its courts less personal jurisdiction authority than it constitutionally could, by excluding cases like Perrone\u2019s, in which communications from outside the state defame a plaintiff in the state. Maybe it just doesn\u2019t want to hear all these cases. For whatever reason, it has not given its courts statutory authority to hear this claim, even though it could have. C is the best answer.",

The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property \u2018\u2018without due process of law,\u2019\u2019 that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it\u2019s a court that\u2019s doing the depriving\u2014by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it\u2014basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have \u2018\u2018a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being \u2018\u2018at home\u2019\u2019 in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That\u2019s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (\u2018\u2018No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u2019\u2019) It says to the states, \u2018\u2018go ahead, define your courts\u2019 jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don\u2019t overreach.\u2019\u2019 It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps. First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant. Second, if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second question: whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.\nQuestion: Perrone, an Acadia resident, sues Margules, a Montanan, in an Acadia state court, for defamation.

            "context": "The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.",
            "question": "Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would",
            "options": "A. hear and decide the jurisdictional objection, since Ito has properly raised the objection by making a special appearance. B. conclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue. C. consider both objections, since it would apply the Massachusetts approach to raising jurisdictional objections. D. conclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him.",
            "ground_truth": "By the way, here\u2019s a quick point on exam-taking strategy, which I may already have made but is worth repeating. The question asks you to assume that Nevada follows the special appearance approach. Suppose that you happen to know that Nevada doesn\u2019t follow that approach anymore? What would you do in answering the question? Remember that the professor is the boss in writing her exam. If she asks you to assume that under Nevada law the court orders the immediate execution in the public square of a defendant who objects to jurisdiction, you should answer the question on that assumption. I wouldn\u2019t recommend answering on the basis of personal knowledge that Nevada actually uses a different rule. This isn\u2019t the real world, it\u2019s a constructed hypothetical and should be answered on its own terms. The real loser here is C. The Nevada court will, of course, apply its own rules concerning the procedure for raising jurisdictional objections in a Nevada law suit. And, the question indicates, its rule is that a defendant waives her objection to personal jurisdiction, even if she comes into court and raises it, if she also raises other arguments. That is just what Ito did here; he objected to jurisdiction, but then raised a defense on the merits as well. True, he raised the objection to personal jurisdiction first, but under (the assumed) Nevada law any response that appears to litigate the substantive issues in the case waives the special appearance and consents to the jurisdiction of the court. So A isn\u2019t quite right; although Ito properly made a special appearance, his later motion raising the limitations issue waives his objection to jurisdiction. Ito should have waited to make his second motion until the personal jurisdiction issue was resolved. D is interesting. Might the court agree that Ito had made a procedural misstep, but still consider the jurisdictional issue, if it appears that the court lacks a basis for requiring Ito to defend in Nevada? Almost certainly not. The point of the special appearance rule is that an appearance that contests any issue other than jurisdiction is a consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel\u2019s in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived. The very point of the special appearance rule is that the defendant waives it by combining it with other objections. Consequently, the court need not consider whether there is some other basis for exercising jurisdiction over Ito. B is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\u2019s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\u2019t. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do.",

You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\nQuestion: Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\nOptions: A. hear and decide the jurisdictional objection, since Ito has properly raised the objection by making a special appearance. B. conclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue. C. consider both objections, since it would apply the Massachusetts approach to raising jurisdictional objections. D. conclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him. E. dismiss the case on the grounds that Ito waived his objection to personal jurisdiction.\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019\n{QC 2} The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n{QC 3} If the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: Ito lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules, which allows for a more flexible approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. {QC 1}\nStep 2: Under the Federal Rules, a defendant can raise objections to personal jurisdiction by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or by including it in the answer to the complaint. {QC 2}\nStep 3: Since Ito is in a state that follows the Federal Rules, he can raise his objection to personal jurisdiction by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or by including it in his answer. {QC 3}\nStep 4: Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, but this is not the correct approach for a state that follows the Federal Rules. {QC 1}\nStep 5: A week later, Ito files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations, which is an issue related to the merits of the case. {QC 3}\nStep 6: By raising the limitations issue, Ito has strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction and has joined issue on the merits, which implies that he has accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate the case. {QC 3}\nStep 7: Since Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue, the court would conclude that he has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction. {QC 3}\nStep 8: The correct answer is that the court would conclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue. {QC 3}\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{B}$",

            "context": "The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person\u2019s property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to tell the defendant that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called \u2018\u2018personal service of process.\u2019\u2019 Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant\u2019s home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as \u2018\u2018constructive service,\u2019\u2019 as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson\u2019s wise opinion in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property\u2014the right to sue the bank for mismanagement\u2014due process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in Mullane was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane held that \u2018\u2018an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019\u2019 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of Mullane, several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in Mullane did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. The question below probes what it did require.",
            "question": "In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., the Supreme Court held that ",
            "options": "A. every person whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding. B. every person whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding.C. any person whose interests might be affected by the proceeding must be given notice by in-hand service of process. D. due to the large number of persons whose interests might be affected by the proceedings, notice by publication was sufficient on the facts of the case. E. None of the above is true.",
            "ground_truth": "A takes the position that everyone who might be affected by the settlement of the accounts must receive individual notice. If that were true, it would be impossible to settle the accounts of the trust. Even some beneficiaries with a current right to income may be impossible to find; if due process required individual notice to them it couldn\u2019t be done. Other people have contingent interests: They might get income in the future, for example, as the heir of a current beneficiary. The bank may not know who these contingent beneficiaries are, though it might be able, with research, to find some of them. Justice Jackson viewed due process as a flexible concept that involves a balance of the importance of the right involved, the risk of an erroneous decision, the cost of providing individual notice, and the likelihood that the absentee\u2019s interest would be protected by other parties. He rejected the view that everyone with some interest in the action must be individually notified for it to proceed. B would impose a lesser burden: to notify the persons whose interests could be ascertained with reasonable investigation. This could be done, but it would be costly, involving legal review of trusts and factual research on the whereabouts of all identified beneficiaries. This would more effectively reach affected persons, but the cost of doing so would likely impose such a severe burden on the plan as to \u2018\u2018dissipate its advantages.\u2019\u2019 339 U.S. at 318. Under the circumstances\u2014including the presence of the guardian appointed to represent the interests of beneficiaries and the actual notice to many of them\u2014the Court held that due process did not require that. Consequently, a beneficiary might never learn of the proceeding, have her right to object to the accounts foreclosed by it, and have no constitutional complaint. C is also a loser. Mullane held that notice by mail is sufficiently likely to actually inform a person of the proceeding to be constitutionally sufficient under most circumstances. In fact, Mullane did not hold that anyone had to be notified of the suit by personal service of process\u2014that is, by in-hand delivery of the papers. And D fails as well. The Court required at least mail notice of the action to those beneficiaries whose names and addresses were known to the bank, since they could easily and inexpensively be informed of the action. So E is right. None of the prior statements is quite true",

            "question": "Dziezek, who resides in the Southern District of Indiana, sues Torruella and Hopkins. Torruella resides in the Western District of Kentucky. Hopkins resides in the Western District of Tennessee. Dziezek sues them both for damages arising out of a business deal for the financing of a subdivision Dziezek planned to build in the Southern District of Ohio. His claim against Torruella is for fraud, his claim against Hopkins is for fraud and for violation of the Federal Truth in Lending Act. The negotiations between the parties for the financing took place in the Western District of Tennessee. Dziezek claimed that, after the defendants had provided the first installment of financing for the project, and he had commenced construction, they refused to provide subsequent payments to the contractor, who consequently did not complete the project. Venue in Dziezek\u2019s action would be proper in",
            "options": "A. the Western District of Kentucky. B. the Southern District of Indiana. C. the Southern District of Ohio. D. Both A and C are true",
            "ground_truth": "Let\u2019s see. Under \u00a71391(b)(1), venue is proper in a district where all defendants reside. But here they don\u2019t all reside in the same district. Nor do they reside in different districts within the same state (in which case the district where either resides would be a proper venue). So \u00a71391(b)(1) doesn\u2019t provide any venue options for Dziezek. He\u2019ll have to look to \u00a71391(b)(2) or (b)(3). Section 1391(b)(2) is more fruitful. It allows venue in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim took place, or where property that is the subject of the action is located. Here, you might argue that the property in the Southern District of Ohio, where the subdivision is being built, is the subject of the action. This is doubtful, since the action is for fraud, not to establish an interest in the real estate. However, venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio anyway. Arguably, the partial construction of the subdivision in that district was a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim. But perhaps not; the claim really arises from the refusal of financing, not from the construction itself. A stronger argument\u2014and I think it\u2019s a winner\u2014is that the omission to pay the contractor on the job took place in the Southern District of Ohio, so that is \u2018\u2018a substantial part of the . . . omissions giving rise to the claim.\u2019\u2019 So C is a correct answer. But B is clearly not: the plaintiff\u2019s residence is not one of the venue options in \u00a71391(b). So the remaining question is whether the Western District of Kentucky, where Torruella resides, is a proper venue. Venue isn\u2019t proper there under \u00a71391(b)(1), which only applies if all defendants reside in districts within the same state. Here, only Torruella resides in Kentucky. Section 1391(b)(3) authorizes jurisdiction\u2014in some cases\u2014in \u2018\u2018a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.\u2019\u2019 Here, Hopkins presumably is subject to personal jurisdiction in the Western District of Kentucky, since he resides there and could be served with process there. However, \u00a71391(b) (3) is not available in this case. That section only applies if there is no other district where the case can be brought under subsection (1) or (2). Here, the Southern District of Ohio is proper. The Western District of Tennessee, where the parties negotiated the contract, would also be proper under \u00a71391 (b)(2). Since Dziezek could choose either of those districts under subsection 2, and both defendants would be subject to jurisdiction there based on their involvement in the subdivision project, \u00a71391(b)(3) never comes into play. Consequently, C is the right answer.",

            "context": "The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789. They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. \u00a71652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law would apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress\u2019s intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as \u2018\u2018the RDA\u2019\u2019) more narrowly in Swift. Justice Story concluded that the phrase, \u2018\u2018the laws of the several states\u2019\u2019 in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that \u2018\u2018The only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,\u2019\u2019 Swift recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state \u2018\u2018law\u2019\u2019 in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct, Swift concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court\u2014even in Pennsylvania\u2014to follow that decision. If it didn\u2019t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply the common law to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn\u2019t think of it as \u2018\u2018Pennsylvania common law,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Georgia common law,\u2019\u2019 but as the common law, which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue\u2014such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser\u2014and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the \u2018\u2018true rule\u2019\u2019 of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities.1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in Swift that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the Swift case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, \u2018\u2018What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,\u2019\u2019 but rather, \u2018\u2018what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?\u2019\u2019 So, under Swift, federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat. Consider the following illustration of life under the Swift regime. Assume that pre-Erie law, that is, the Swift doctrine, applies.",
            "question": "Thomas is injured while walking along the railroad right of way in Pennsylvania in 1910, during the heyday of Swift v. Tyson. He is hit by something protruding from the train, perhaps a door. He sues the Erie Railroad Company in federal court for his injuries, basing federal jurisdiction on diversity. He alleges that the Railroad owed him a duty of due care, since it was aware that trespassers routinely used the right-of-way. Pennsylvania had no statute covering the duty of care owed to a railroad trespasser, but Pennsylvania cases had held that railroads owed trespassers only a duty to avoid willful or wanton conduct. Assume that no federal statute or constitutional provision applies",
            "options": "A. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story in Swift v. Tyson, would require the federal court to apply Pennsylvania law to Thomas\u2019s claim. B. Under Swift v. Tyson, the federal court would apply Pennsylvania common law to Thomas\u2019s claim, because its jurisdiction was based on diversity. C. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story, would require the federal judge to apply federal law to Thomas\u2019s claim. D. None of the above is true.",
            "ground_truth": "Actually, none of the above is true, except D. Each mistakes the holding of Swift v. Tyson in one way or another. A fails because Justice Story held that the Rules of Decision Act did not require federal courts to apply common law rules of the state in which they sat. Instead, Swift held that the federal court should make its own judgment as to the proper common law rule, based on its review of all relevant cases and secondary authorities. It might conclude that the willful/wanton rule was appropriate, and choose to apply it, but it might also conclude that the Pennsylvania cases did not represent the correct approach to trespasser liability, and apply a different rule under Swift\u2019s \u2018\u2018general common law\u2019\u2019 approach. B also contains a fatal flaw. It states that Swift required the federal court in a diversity case to apply Pennsylvania common law in deciding Thomas\u2019s case. Swift\u2019s holding was quite the contrary: The point of Swift was that the federal judge in a diversity case (even a Pennsylvania federal judge) did not have to apply Pennsylvania common law\u2014the decisions of the Pennsylvania state courts\u2014in deciding the appropriate standard of care owed to Thomas. Under Swift, the federal judge was to apply the \u2018\u2018general common law,\u2019\u2019 looking at relevant authorities from Pennsylvania, from other states, from English cases, and secondary authorities as well, in determining what the \u2018\u2018true rule\u2019\u2019 of duty of care to a trespasser should be. Indeed, the mindset was, in a sense, that there was no such thing as \u2018\u2018the common law of Pennsylvania,\u2019\u2019 but rather a general body of law called the common law, that judges from all state and federal courts attempted to perceive and apply correctly. C also misstates the holding of Swift. The RDA, even in the heyday of Swift, required federal courts to apply federal law where a federal statute or constitutional provision applied. Or, if a state statute or \u2018\u2018local usage\u2019\u2019 applied, it should be applied in a diversity case. If there were no state statute or local usage involved, and no federal statute or constitutional provision at issue, the RDA did not dictate the governing law at all. Instead, Swift v. Tyson itself held that the federal court should apply \u2018\u2018general common law,\u2019\u2019 based on its reading of all the authorities, not just the holdings of the local state courts. So, if one of the choices had been \u2018\u2018Under Swift v. Tyson, the federal court would look to the general common law to determine the applicable duty of care,\u2019\u2019 that would have taken the prize.",

They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. \u00a71652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law would apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress\u2019s intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as \u2018\u2018the RDA\u2019\u2019) more narrowly in Swift. Justice Story concluded that the phrase, \u2018\u2018the laws of the several states\u2019\u2019 in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that \u2018\u2018The only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,\u2019\u2019 Swift recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state \u2018\u2018law\u2019\u2019 in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct, Swift concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court\u2014even in Pennsylvania\u2014to follow that decision. If it didn\u2019t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply the common law to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn\u2019t think of it as \u2018\u2018Pennsylvania common law,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Georgia common law,\u2019\u2019 but as the common law, which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue\u2014such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser\u2014and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the \u2018\u2018true rule\u2019\u2019 of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities.1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in Swift that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the Swift case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, \u2018\u2018What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,\u2019\u2019 but rather, \u2018\u2018what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?\u2019\u2019 So, under Swift, federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat. Consider the following illustration of life under the Swift regime. Assume that pre-Erie law, that is, the Swift doctrine, applies.\nQuestion: Thomas is injured while walking along the railroad right of way in Pennsylvania in 1910, during the heyday of Swift v. Tyson. He is hit by something protruding from the train, perhaps a door. He sues the Erie Railroad Company in federal court for his injuries, basing federal jurisdiction on diversity. He alleges that the Railroad owed him a duty of due care, since it was aware that trespassers routinely used the right-of-way. Pennsylvania had no statute covering the duty of care owed to a railroad trespasser, but Pennsylvania cases had held that railroads owed trespassers only a duty to avoid willful or wanton conduct. Assume that no federal statute or constitutional provision applies\nOptions: A. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story in Swift v. Tyson, would require the federal court to apply Pennsylvania law to Thomas\u2019s claim. B. Under Swift v. Tyson, the federal court would apply Pennsylvania common law to Thomas\u2019s claim, because its jurisdiction was based on diversity. C. The Rules of Decision Act, as interpreted by Justice Story, would require the federal judge to apply federal law to Thomas\u2019s claim. D. None of the above is true. E. The federal court would apply the common law to Thomas\u2019s claim, as interpreted by the federal judge, rather than Pennsylvania common law.\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789.\n{QC 2} They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since.\n{QC 3} The Act reads: 28 U.S.C. \u00a71652.

It doesn\u2019t say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn\u2019t say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says anything may be joined . . . so why shouldn\u2019t you believe it? D is right. B is tempting, because so many of the joinder rules do limit the right to join claims to those arising from the same transaction or occurrence. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a); 13(g). It is also tempting because it would seem to make sense to allow Felina to litigate related claims together, but not to allow her to throw in the kitchen sink. But that\u2019s just what the rule does. The rule-makers took the view that, as long as the parties are going to have a lawsuit, they might as well drag out any claims they have and resolve them all. Under the Federal Rules, the court can hear and determine both legal and equitable claims, and can grant almost any type of relief the plaintiff seeks. In addition, most cases aren\u2019t tried, they are compromised through settlement, and the settlement is likely to be more effective if it encompasses all the claims the parties have against each other rather than just some. If the various claims do go to trial, the unrelated ones can be separated for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). So the rule-makers opted for the broadest possible scope of joinder of claims. They did not require that they arise from the same events, as both B and C suggest. They didn\u2019t limit joinder to claims that seek the same type of relief, as A would. Whatever you\u2019ve got, Felina, go for it. Would that all the rules were so clear. One caveat should be noted, however. Even if Rule 18(a) (or any other rule) authorizes joinder, the court must still have a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over each claim a party asserts. The fact that Rule 18(a) authorizes joinder should always be read as if it included the following phrase: \u2018\u2018assuming that the court would have a basis for exercising jurisdiction over the added claims.\u2019\u2019 Often, such jurisdiction will be proper in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute.",

            "context": "The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a72 and others that don\u2019t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative fact.\u2019\u2019 In Tolman\u2019s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, \u00a72, as interpreted in Gibbs, to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court\u2019s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a \u2018\u2018federal hook\u2019\u2019\u2014here, the FLSA claim\u2014from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So Gibbs recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman\u2019s contract claim. But in Kroger, the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can\u2019t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in Gibbs. Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that Gibbs provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise \u2018\u2018supplemental jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over related claims in proper federal cases. Here\u2019s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a). Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction,\u2019\u2019 because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 And, the legislative history of \u00a71367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the Gibbs \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative fact\u2019\u2019 test are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 So, as long as the court has a federal \u2018\u2018hook\u2019\u2019\u2014a claim properly within the federal court\u2019s original jurisdiction\u2014it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There\u2019s more to \u00a71367, but for now let\u2019s focus on this basic purpose of \u00a71367(a).",
            "question": "Garabedian, an Arkansas developer, sues Ellis, a local Arkansas official, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, for deprivation of his First Amendment rights, for refusing to allow him to speak at a local zoning meeting concerning a proposal by a competitor. He adds a second claim against Ellis for defamation, a state tort claim, based on statements Ellis made to the local newspaper about the quality of the construction on several houses Garabedian had built in town. The federal court",
            "options": "A. has constitutional authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim under Gibbs, but does not have statutory authority to do so under \u00a71367(a). B. has statutory authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim under \u00a71367(a), but it would be unconstitutional, under Gibbs, for the court to do so. C. has both constitutional and statutory authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim. D. has neither constitutional nor statutory authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim.",
            "ground_truth": "This is pretty straightforward, but there\u2019s no harm in building a little self-confidence as we wade into a difficult subject. Here, the \u00a71983 claim arises under federal law. The federal court has \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over it. That is, it is a claim that, on its own, may be brought in federal court under arising-under jurisdiction. So it provides that necessary federal hook from which to hang related state law claims. Since there is a proper federal claim, Gibbs holds that it is constitutionally permissible to hear jurisdictionally insufficient claims (like Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim) if they arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the proper federal claim. And, in \u00a71367(a), Congress authorized federal courts, where there is a claim within the federal court\u2019s \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction,\u2019\u2019 to hear other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims if they are part of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 These two tests basically require the same thing: that the state law claim arise out of the same underlying dispute as the federal claim. The cases indicate that Congress, in using the phrase \u2018\u2018same case or controversy\u2019\u2019 in \u00a71367(a), meant to give supplemental jurisdiction to the full reach that Gibbs held constitutionally permissible under the \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative fact\u2019\u2019 test. So, since the constitutional test under Gibbs and the statutory test under \u00a71367(a) are the same, both A and B have to be wrong. If the defamation claim satisfies the Gibbs test, it satisfies the statute; if it doesn\u2019t satisfy Gibbs, it doesn\u2019t satisfy the statute. The question primarily tests whether you\u2019ve got that basic point down. If you do, it only remains to decide whether the defamation claim arises from the same set of facts as the First Amendment claim. C is wrong, because it pretty clearly doesn\u2019t. Even if Garabedian and Ellis have a long-running local feud going, and both claims arise from the bad blood between the parties, these appear to be separate incidents that took place at different times and involve different issues. Thus, Gibbs would not support sweeping in the jurisdictionally insufficient claim, just because Garabedian can sue on the First Amendment claim in federal court. There has to be a limit on this inferential extension of federal jurisdiction to claims not expressly authorized in Article III, \u00a72. The limit is the scope of a single dispute, and this one looks like two distinct disputes, though perhaps linked by ongoing animosity. So D is the best choice here.",

Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a72 and others that don\u2019t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative fact.\u2019\u2019 In Tolman\u2019s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, \u00a72, as interpreted in Gibbs, to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court\u2019s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a \u2018\u2018federal hook\u2019\u2019\u2014here, the FLSA claim\u2014from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So Gibbs recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman\u2019s contract claim. But in Kroger, the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can\u2019t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in Gibbs. Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that Gibbs provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise \u2018\u2018supplemental jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over related claims in proper federal cases. Here\u2019s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a). Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction,\u2019\u2019 because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 And, the legislative history of \u00a71367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the Gibbs \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative fact\u2019\u2019 test are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 So, as long as the court has a federal \u2018\u2018hook\u2019\u2019\u2014a claim properly within the federal court\u2019s original jurisdiction\u2014it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There\u2019s more to \u00a71367, but for now let\u2019s focus on this basic purpose of \u00a71367(a).\nQuestion: Garabedian, an Arkansas developer, sues Ellis, a local Arkansas official, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, for deprivation of his First Amendment rights, for refusing to allow him to speak at a local zoning meeting concerning a proposal by a competitor. He adds a second claim against Ellis for defamation, a state tort claim, based on statements Ellis made to the local newspaper about the quality of the construction on several houses Garabedian had built in town. The federal court\nOptions: A. has constitutional authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim under Gibbs, but does not have statutory authority to do so under \u00a71367(a). B. has statutory authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim under \u00a71367(a), but it would be unconstitutional, under Gibbs, for the court to do so.

            "context": "The plaintiff starts the ball rolling by filing a complaint, but what has to be in it? Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) \u2018\u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is notice to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This \u2018\u2018short and plain statement\u2019\u2019 requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.",

The complaint provides the date and the place of the accident (and, or course, the name of the victim, since the plaintiff\u2019s name is in the caption of the complaint\u2014see Rule 10(a)). This is probably enough to give Noble notice of the events he is being sued for. After all, how many accidents did he have with Carstairs on Main Street on June 14? Noble has enough information about the source of Carstairs\u2019s claim that he can begin to investigate it and form a defense. He can get the additional detail he needs through discovery. C takes the position that Carstairs\u2019s complaint is insufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) because it does not expressly allege that Noble owed him a duty of care. In a simple case, it is probably sufficient to allege the claim generally, or perhaps even to allege facts that show that the plaintiff may be able to prove those elements. The plaintiff will of course have to prove every element in order to recover, but it is unlikely that the judge would require Carstairs to amend to add an allegation that Noble owed him a duty of care. If, in a complex case, the plaintiff has not alleged an element, and the defendant doubts that the plaintiff has grounds to plead it under the constraints of Rule 11, he will likely challenge the plaintiff\u2019s complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In this situation, the motion challenges whether the plaintiff can allege each element necessary to establish her claims, and may lead the judge to require the plaintiff to amend to include the disputed allegation. See Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598 (1998) (authorizing trial judges to require specific allegations where plaintiff\u2019s ability to make them is challenged). In a straightforward negligence case, however, it is very doubtful that a judge would deem the complaint insufficient for failure to expressly allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. However, though the complaint may be very spare, it ought to provide an indication that \u2018\u2018the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A plaintiff cannot recover from a driver simply because the driver hit him on Main Street. Something more is needed to show that Carstairs is entitled to damages from Noble: a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s legal rights. This complaint doesn\u2019t allege that Noble did anything wrong, simply that he hit him. Contrary to public belief, an accident victim isn\u2019t entitled to damages just because he was hurt; he must prove that the driver was at fault. The word \u2018\u2018negligently\u2019\u2019 after \u2018\u2018driving\u2019\u2019 would put the court and Noble on notice that Carstairs alleges that the accident resulted from Noble\u2019s fault, which would show an entitlement to relief. Absent some suggestion of carelessness by Noble, the complaint arguably doesn\u2019t \u2018\u2018state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019\u2019 On the other hand, the logic of Rule 8(a)(2) is to provide an informal description of the claim, not a mechanical black letter pronouncement of every element required in order to recover. It seems that a judge, who is supposed to take all inferences in the pleader\u2019s favor in determining whether he has stated a claim, could reasonably infer that Carstairs alleges that Noble was driving negligently. After all, he has sued him for damages. Well, maybe so, but I think the better view is that the complaint should contain some indication that the claim alleged entitles the pleader to relief, and that means that the complaint should suggest a legal right of the plaintiff that the defendant has violated. On this reasoning, D represents the best argument that the complaint is insufficient. Some judges would likely so rule; others would probably let it go forward.",

Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court\u2019s jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) \u2018\u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is notice to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This \u2018\u2018short and plain statement\u2019\u2019 requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.\nQuestion: Carstairs is injured when he is hit by Noble\u2019s car. He sues Noble in federal court, alleging that the court has jurisdiction on the basis of diversity, that \u2018\u2018the defendant hit me while driving down Main Street on June 14, 2016,\u2019\u2019 and that he suffered physical injuries as a result. He demands $100,000 in damages. Which of the following is the best argument that the complaint is insufficient under Rule 8(a)(2)?\nOptions: A. The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not give Noble notice of the events that are the basis of the suit. B. The quoted allegation is inadequate because it provides insufficient detail concerning the location and time of the accident.C. The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. D. The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not suggest that Noble has violated a legal right that gives Carstairs a right to relief from him. E.

            "context": "The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).) Rule 11 (from https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11) : (a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name\u2014or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or party's attention. (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper\u2014whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it\u2014an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.",

A lawyer files a complaint seeking damages for medical expenses her client claims to have suffered, without seeking any evidence from the client that she incurred those expenses.",
            "ground_truth": "Rule 11 does not apply to all acts in the course of litigation, or even to most. It applies only to representations made before the court. The first sentence of Rule 11(b) makes that clear: The certifications under the Rule apply when a lawyer or unrepresented party \u2018\u2018present[s] to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper\u2014whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating\u2019\u2019 that submission. In the question, only D involves such a filing. By filing the complaint, Middleton \u2018\u2018presented to the court\u2019\u2019 the demand for medical expenses. That act of filing the pleading triggers the representations in Rule 11(b) about positions taken in that pleading.

They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).) Rule 11 (from https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11) : (a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name\u2014or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or party's attention. (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper\u2014whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it\u2014an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.\nQuestion: Which of the following acts might subject a litigant to sanctions under Rule 11?\nOptions: A.

            "context": "When a plaintiff files a complaint in federal court, the defendant must file a response to it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) describes her options. The rule provides, in the first sentence, that the defendant should put every defense that she has to a claim in her answer to the complaint. However, if the defendant has certain objections to the case, she may raise them by a \u2018\u2018pre-answer motion\u2019\u2019 before pleading, that is, before answering the complaint. If the defendant makes a pre-answer motion, it suspends the time for answering the complaint until the court addresses the objections raised in the motion. See Rule 12(a)(4)(A), (B). Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1 . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2 . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3 . improper venue; 4 . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5 . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6 . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7 . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint. A crucial point about Rule 12 pre-answer motions is that the defendant never has to make one. Making a pre-answer motion to assert these defenses is allowed, but not required. If the defendant prefers, she may raise any of these seven objections\u2014or all of them\u2014in her answer instead. I always snare a reasonable percentage of students on this basic point. Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the point.",

It is perfectly appropriate for the defendant to respond by answering the complaint, and to include in that answer any objections she has, including those listed in Rule 12(b). A responding party never has to make a pre-answer motion to raise these objections. B, which states that Trinh\u2019s objection must be raised in a pre-answer motion, is wrong. So is D, because a defendant does not waive any Rule 12(b) objections by failing to make a pre-answer motion. She would waive certain Rule 12(b) objections by making a pre-answer motion and leaving them out; but you don\u2019t forfeit any of these defenses by choosing to answer instead of moving to dismiss. C is also wrong, because it states that an objection to personal jurisdiction cannot be raised in the answer, that it must be asserted by motion.

If the defendant makes a pre-answer motion, it suspends the time for answering the complaint until the court addresses the objections raised in the motion. See Rule 12(a)(4)(A), (B). Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1 . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2 . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3 . improper venue; 4 . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5 . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6 . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7 . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint. A crucial point about Rule 12 pre-answer motions is that the defendant never has to make one. Making a pre-answer motion to assert these defenses is allowed, but not required. If the defendant prefers, she may raise any of these seven objections\u2014or all of them\u2014in her answer instead. I always snare a reasonable percentage of students on this basic point. Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the point.\nQuestion: Creasey sues Trinh in federal court in Florida for injuries suffered in an accident in Alabama. Trinh files an answer to the complaint, including in the answer to an allegation that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over her. The objection to personal jurisdiction\nOptions: A. is proper, and will be considered and decided by the court. B. is proper, as long as it was also asserted in a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). C. should be stricken, because the objection must be raised by a motion, not in a responsive pleading.D. should be stricken. Trinh waived it by failing to file a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (2) asserting the objection. E. is proper, because Trinh has not waived the objection by failing to file a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} A defendant in a federal court case can file a pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b) to raise certain objections to the case, such as lack of personal jurisdiction.\n{QC 2} These objections include lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of process, insufficient service of process, improper venue, insufficient process, failure to state a claim, and failure to join a party under Rule 19.\n{QC 3} A defendant does not have to make a pre-answer motion; instead, they can raise any of these objections in their answer to the complaint.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: Trinh has raised an objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer to the complaint. {QC 3} indicates that this is an acceptable way to raise objections, as the defendant does not have to make a pre-answer motion. Therefore, Trinh has not waived the objection by failing to file a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).\nStep 2: Based on Step 1, we can conclude that the objection to personal jurisdiction is proper. {QC 1} supports this conclusion, as the defendant has the option to raise certain objections, including lack of personal jurisdiction, by a pre-answer motion, but it is not required.\nStep 3: Since the objection to personal jurisdiction is proper, the court will consider and decide it. {QC 2} lists the objections that can be raised by a pre-answer motion, and personal jurisdiction is one of them. Therefore, the court will address Trinh's objection to personal jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer: E. is the correct answer. Trinh has not waived the objection to personal jurisdiction by failing to file a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), as she can raise the objection in her answer to the complaint. The objection is proper, and the court will consider and decide it. \n\nNote: This response is based on the provided legal context and question, and it is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive legal analysis.

            "context": "A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).",
            "question": "Karim sues Precision Machine Company after she suffers a serious injury to her hand using a stamping machine manufactured by Precision. Her suit is brought after the statute of limitations (A statute of limitations, known in civil law systems as a prescriptive period, is a law passed by a legislative body to set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated.) on a strict products liability claim has expired, so her complaint alleges negligence by Precision in the design of the machine. Karim\u2019s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such \u2018\u2018subsequent remedial measures\u2019\u2019 is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory",
            "options": "A. is not within the scope of discovery, because evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible at trial under the relevant rules of evidence. B. is not within the scope of discovery, because it concerns events taking place after Karim\u2019s injury, and is thus irrelevant to her claim in the action. C. would be within the scope of discovery under the earlier standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), but is not subject to discovery under the 2000 amendment to that rule. D. is within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).",
            "ground_truth": "A is pretty much a throwaway. Rule 26(b)(1) explicitly provides that information is discoverable, even if it could not be admitted into evidence at trial, if it meets the broad relevance standard in the rule. The idea is that information might assist a party in developing her case, even though it could not be presented at trial. This is manifestly true in many cases. For example, the hearsay statement \u2018\u2018I heard Smith say that a Federal Express delivery man drove away after the accident\u2019\u2019 might be inadmissible hearsay. But this information could clearly assist the plaintiff in finding an important witness. Similarly, in an assault case, evidence that a witness had heard of instances of violence by the defendant would likely be inadmissible hearsay, yet could lead to the discovery of evidence of violent conduct that could be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony about who started a fight. B rests on the assumption that events taking place after a claim arises are irrelevant to the issues in a law suit. However, such evidence frequently leads to admissible evidence relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. For example, in the assault case, evidence of later assaults by a defendant would be relevant to impeach him if he testifies that the plaintiff started the quarrel. Similarly, evidence that a company consistently promoted men over women\u2014before and after the plaintiff was passed over\u2014would assist a sex discrimination plaintiff to show a pattern of discriminatory conduct. Here, evidence that the company made its stamping machine safer after the accident is certainly relevant to the case. It suggests that the machine can be made safer, which may mean that they were aware of that before Karim\u2019s accident but decided, for whatever reason, not to improve it. If Karim\u2019s counsel discovers that they have added a guard, she can take depositions of Precision\u2019s engineers, to determine when they developed the design for the guard, and why it was not added before. This could lead to evidence suggesting that Precision was negligent, because it was aware of the need for the guard but delayed introducing it. Surely, this information is not only \u2018\u2018relevant to the subject matter in the action\u2019\u2019 (the Rule 26(b)(1) standard before the 2000 amendment), but also \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim\u2019\u2019 of a party (the current standard in Rule 26(b)(1)). It is relevant to Karim\u2019s claim that Precision negligently failed to act with reasonable care in designing the stamping machine. Thus, C fails; D is the best answer.",

However, Rule 26(a) also requires \u2018\u2018automatic disclosure\u2019\u2019 of certain categories of information\u2014 that is, an exchange of this information among the parties without a request for it from another party. Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose \u2022 the identity of individuals \u2018\u2018likely to have discoverable information\u2014along with the subjects of that information\u2014that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses\u2019\u2019 \u2022 copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information) and things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses \u2022 a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based \u2022 any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f). Until this meeting takes place, the parties are barred from taking discovery by other means (such as interrogatories, requests for documents, or depositions). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness\u2019s testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness\u2019s testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party \u2018\u2018may use to support its claims or defenses.\u2019\u2019 Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal supporting evidence, but not adverse evidence. This avoids placing counsel in the position of having to review all known evidence, locate all documents that might support the other party\u2019s case, and hand them over without a request.",
            "question": "Fremont Publishing Company sues New Era Press for publishing a story about a shipwreck that it claims duplicated a copyrighted story from one of its books. New Era denies that Fremont held the copyright to the story. Shortly after the parties make their disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1), New Era\u2019s lawyers learn that Fremont had received a letter a year earlier from an individual claiming that he held the copyright on the shipwreck story and demanding compensation from Fremont for using it. Fremont had not disclosed the existence of this letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures.",
            "options": "A. should move for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1) for Fremont\u2019s failure to disclose the letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures. B. should move to require supplemental disclosure of the letter, under Rules 26(a)(1) and 26(e)(1). C. should send Fremont a Rule 34 Request for Production of documents to obtain the letter. D. cannot obtain the letter, because it is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a).",
            "ground_truth": "In this example, Fremont evidently had the document but failed to include it in its initial disclosure. New Era learns that it exists and was left out. What should it do? B seems like a sensible course, to move for further disclosure, since the letter was not produced. This isn\u2019t likely to be granted, however, because the letter probably does not have to be disclosed. Rule 26(a)(1) (A)(ii) requires disclosure of documents the disclosing party \u2018\u2018may use to support its claims or defenses.\u2019\u2019 It hardly seems that Fremont will use this letter, challenging the validity of its copyright, to support its claim against New Era for infringing that copyright. If the letter was not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii), the court is not going to order it disclosed in response to New Era\u2019s motion. For the same reason, the motion for sanctions suggested in A isn\u2019t going to be granted: Fremont would not be sanctioned for failure to disclose the letter if it was not required to disclose it. D suggests that New Era cannot obtain the letter, since it is not within the scope of disclosure under Rule 26(a). While the letter very probably is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a), that does not mean that New Era cannot obtain it through discovery. It only means that Fremont does not have to disclose it automatically at the outset of the case. It is still discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1), which allows parties to obtain discovery of information \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 in the action. Surely, the letter is relevant to New Era\u2019s defense that Fremont did not have a copyright on the story. Consequently, it is subject to discovery under the broad standard of relevance in Rule 26(b)(1). So C is the best answer: New Era is entitled to obtain this letter through the traditional discovery devices and may send Fremont a request for production of the letter under Rule 34. This illustrates that a party cannot rely on disclosure as a substitute for discovery. Disclosure will only reveal information favorable to the other party (that it may \u2018\u2018use to support its claims or defenses\u2019\u2019). To obtain information that is unfavorable to Fremont, New Era must ask for it using the traditional discovery devices.",

Certainly, such facts are relevant evidence of a person\u2019s intent to remain in a state, or not to. But keep in mind that the  test itself  is the person\u2019s intent. Evidence about her practical affairs may help to demonstrate her subjective intent, but a person is not automatically domiciled where she has an apartment, or votes, or maintains her health insurance. If she were,  that would be the test,  rather than her subjective intent. Parties introduce such practical evidence about a person\u2019s conduct to prove the ultimately relevant fact: her intent.

            "question": "Rossi grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. In August 2017, she departed for college in Idaho. After starting school in Idaho, she registered her car there and established a bank account there. She gets health coverage through college. She has an apartment there, which she has taken on a one-year lease. She has a part-time job in Idaho, and has Idaho state taxes taken out of her check. On her application for the job she listed her Idaho address and telephone number. Her plan is to complete a two-year computer technician degree, and then return to Pennsylvania, where her fiancee has just taken over his family\u2019s construction business in Erie. (They have reserved a hall for their wedding in June 2019.) However, she may need a bit more than two years to finish the degree, if tuition goes up too much. Three months after arriving in Idaho, Rossi brings suit against a Pennsylvania surgeon, for an injury suffered in an operation performed in Pennsylvania a year before. She sues in federal court on the basis of diversity. The court will probably conclude that Rossi is domiciled in",
            "options": "A.  Pennsylvania, since she is only in Idaho as a student.B.  Pennsylvania, since she intends to return to Pennsylvania when she finishes her degree.C.

Idaho, since she doesn\u2019t know when she will finish the college program.E.  Idaho, if she testifies in her deposition that she plans to remain there indefinitely.",
            "ground_truth": "Let\u2019s start with  C , which suggests that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho because she has an apartment there, an Idaho job, health insurance there, and so on. The example illustrates a situation in which most of these practical facts suggest that one state is the domicile, but it probably isn\u2019t. Here, there are good reasons for Rossi to arrange her practical affairs as she has, even if she plans to leave Idaho. If you went to school in a state, wouldn\u2019t you need a place to live? Wouldn\u2019t you get a job if you needed money? Wouldn\u2019t you give your local address so the employer could get in touch with you? Wouldn\u2019t you join the college health plan? Very likely, you would do all of these things, whether you intended to leave the state when you finished the degree or not. In this case, there\u2019s a perfectly good explanation for all these practical choices, even if Rossi has definite plans to leave the state. So, these facts do not themselves establish that Rossi has an open-ended commitment to living in Idaho. So  C  is wrong. D  suggests that Rossi is domiciled in Idaho, because she doesn\u2019t know exactly when she will finish her degree. However, while Rossi doesn\u2019t know when she will finish, she does have definite plans to leave Idaho when she does. Since she plans to leave upon the occurrence of a particular event, her stay is not open-ended. She\u2019s an Idaho visitor, not a domiciliary, under domicile analysis. But  A  isn\u2019t right either. It implies that you can never establish a domicile by going to a state as a student. That isn\u2019t so. If you go to a state to attend school, without definite plans beyond your studies, you can establish a domicile there. Many students do satisfy the reside-with- intent-to-remain-indefinitely test by going to school. A case in point, on which this example is very loosely based, is  Gordon v. Steele,  376 F. Supp. 575 (W.D. Pa. 1974). How about  E , which takes the position that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho if she testifies that she plans to remain there indefinitely? Would this be dispositive? Surely not. People do sometimes lie. More often, some motive, such as access to federal court, may color their view of a subjective fact. In determining Rossi\u2019s domicile, the court would look at all the evidence, not just her testimony. Here, the facts pointing to Idaho are easily explained on another basis. And the fact that her fiancee has taken over the family business and they plan to marry at the time she will likely complete her studies very strongly suggests that she intends to return. Her testimony is important evidence about her intent, but not solely dispositive. So  B  is the best answer. Rossi has not established a domicile in Idaho, because she went there with clear plans to leave when she finished her degree. The question tells you that she plans to leave, and her engagement clearly corroborates her intent to go back to Erie. So the point is that the practical factors may be useful in evaluating a person\u2019s subjective intent. But the ultimate fact to be proved, under the domicile test, is the intent itself.",

Cite the premises used to support each reasoning step in the format: {QC #}, where # refers to the premise number.\n3. Clearly explain how each step leads to the final answer.\n4. The reasoning steps should be in a sequential, deductive chain, with each step based only on the premises and steps generated previously.\n\nPlease ensure that the output is clearly separated by special markers so that it can be parsed into individual elements later on.\n\n---\n\n\nStart with the Question-Context steps, followed by the Reasoning steps. Use the following structure:\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} statement or relationship given/inferred in the Question and Legal Context.\n{QC 2} statement or relationship given/inferred in the Question and Legal Context.\n{QC 3} statement or relationship given/inferred in the Question and Legal Context.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: [Premise-based reasoning derived from {QC 1}, {QC 2}, etc.]\nStep 2: [Next reasoning step derived from previous steps and citing relevant premises]\n...\nStep N: [Final reasoning step and conclusion based on the chain of reasoning]\n\nContext: Cases analyzing domicile for purposes of diversity frequently cite evidence about the person\u2019s practical affairs, in order to establish a party\u2019s intent. The court may rely on facts such as where the party votes, has health insurance, has a driver\u2019s license, rents an apartment, has a bank account, registers her car, and so forth. Certainly, such facts are relevant evidence of a person\u2019s intent to remain in a state, or not to. But keep in mind that the  test itself  is the person\u2019s intent. Evidence about her practical affairs may help to demonstrate her subjective intent, but a person is not automatically domiciled where she has an apartment, or votes, or maintains her health insurance. If she were,  that would be the test,  rather than her subjective intent. Parties introduce such practical evidence about a person\u2019s conduct to prove the ultimately relevant fact: her intent. But a person could be domiciled in Wisconsin, even though most of these practical factors point to Illinois. It\u2019s all a matter of trying to ascertain a subjective fact based on all the evidence. A court will certainly look at the party\u2019s testimony in assessing intent, but will also consider whether her practical conduct corroborates or refutes that testimony.\nQuestion: Rossi grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. In August 2017, she departed for college in Idaho. After starting school in Idaho, she registered her car there and established a bank account there. She gets health coverage through college. She has an apartment there, which she has taken on a one-year lease. She has a part-time job in Idaho, and has Idaho state taxes taken out of her check. On her application for the job she listed her Idaho address and telephone number. Her plan is to complete a two-year computer technician degree, and then return to Pennsylvania, where her fiancee has just taken over his family\u2019s construction business in Erie. (They have reserved a hall for their wedding in June 2019.) However, she may need a bit more than two years to finish the degree, if tuition goes up too much. Three months after arriving in Idaho, Rossi brings suit against a Pennsylvania surgeon, for an injury suffered in an operation performed in Pennsylvania a year before. She sues in federal court on the basis of diversity. The court will probably conclude that Rossi is domiciled in\nOptions: A.  Pennsylvania, since she is only in Idaho as a student.B.  Pennsylvania, since she intends to return to Pennsylvania when she finishes her degree.C.  Idaho, since she has an apartment there, goes to school there, has a job there, has health coverage there and pays Idaho state taxes on her income.D.  Idaho, since she doesn\u2019t know when she will finish the college program.E.  Idaho, if she testifies in her deposition that she plans to remain there indefinitely. However, if she doesn\u2019t testify to that, she is domiciled in Pennsylvania.\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} Rossi grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n{QC 2} Rossi departed for college in Idaho in August 2017.\n{QC 3} Rossi has established a bank account in Idaho.\n{QC 4} Rossi gets health coverage through college.\n{QC 5} Rossi has an apartment in Idaho, which she has taken on a one-year lease.\n{QC 6} Rossi has a part-time job in Idaho and has Idaho state taxes taken out of her check.\n{QC 7} Rossi listed her Idaho address and telephone number on her job application.\n{QC 8} Rossi plans to complete a two-year computer technician degree and then return to Pennsylvania.\n{QC 9} Rossi may need more than two years to finish her degree.\n{QC 10} Rossi brings suit against a Pennsylvania surgeon for an injury suffered in an operation performed in Pennsylvania a year before.\n{QC 11} Rossi sues in federal court on the basis of diversity.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: Rossi's intent is the key factor in determining her domicile, and her practical affairs may help demonstrate that intent. {QC 1, QC 2}\nStep 2: Rossi's actions in Idaho, such as registering her car, establishing a bank account, and getting health coverage, may suggest that she intends to remain in Idaho, but her testimony about her plans to return to Pennsylvania after completing her degree is also relevant. {QC 3, QC 4, QC 5, QC 6, QC 7}\nStep 3: Rossi's lease on her apartment in Idaho is for one year, which may indicate that she intends to remain in Idaho for at least that period, but her overall plan to return to Pennsylvania after completing her degree suggests that her domicile is still in Pennsylvania. {QC 5, QC 8}\nStep 4: Rossi's uncertainty about how long it will take her to finish her degree may affect her plans, but it does not necessarily change her intent to return to Pennsylvania after completing her studies. {QC 9}\nStep 5: Considering all the evidence, including Rossi's testimony and her practical affairs in Idaho, the court will likely conclude that her domicile is still in Pennsylvania, as she intends to return there after completing her degree. {QC 1, QC 8, QC 10, QC 11}",

            "context": "Remember that  Mottley is frequently referred to as the \u2018\u2018well-pleaded complaint\u2019\u2019 rule, because it requires the court to consider not what the plaintiff has pleaded, but what she needed to plead  to state her cause of action. Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad\u2019s anticipated defense) doesn\u2019t mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it\u2019s hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it\u2019s fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn\u2019t claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is \u2018\u2018We made a contract with the railroad, it didn\u2019t perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.\u2019\u2019 That is the substance of the Mottleys\u2019 position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad\u2019s reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn\u2019t  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn\u2019t make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could \u2018\u2018make a federal case\u2019\u2019 out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction.",
            "question": "Olefsky, from Florida, is diagnosed with leukemia. Testing of his well determines that it is polluted with toxic chemicals, which may have caused his disease. Officials investigate and determine that the chemicals had migrated through the ground-water from a nearby landfill run by Acme Disposal Corporation, a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Florida. The landfill is completely lined, to prevent leaching into the groundwater, but several years ago one of Acme\u2019s drivers had dumped a load outside the lined area. The investigation also revealed other problems with Acme\u2019s waste management practices. For example, Acme had violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests with the Environmental Protection Agency detailing the contents of shipments of hazardous wastes, as required by the Act. Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries. The complaint also alleges that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests (though it does not allege damages arising from those violations). Acme moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.",
            "options": "A.  The motion will be denied if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act.B.  The motion will be denied, because Olefsky has alleged a violation of federal law in his complaint.C.  The motion will be granted, even if the case arises under federal law, because Acme\u2019s principal place of business is in Florida, so that the parties are not diverse.D.  The motion will be granted, since Olefsky\u2019s case does not \u2018\u2018arise under\u2019\u2019 federal law, as that phrase is interpreted in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.",
            "ground_truth": "Sometimes the most basic points about a subject are the most confusing. It\u2019s very important to recognize what is wrong with the third choice here.  C  suggests that there must be both diversity  and  a federal question in order to sue in federal court. Not so; a plaintiff may sue in federal court as long as her case satisfies  one category  of federal jurisdiction . . . it doesn\u2019t have to fit into two, or ten! Thus, if this case arises under federal law, it can be brought in federal court, even though the parties are both from Florida. Conversely, if they were diverse, the case could be brought in federal court even if it arose under state law. Does Olefsky\u2019s case arise under federal law?  A  suggests that it does if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. However, even if Acme violated the Act, that doesn\u2019t mean that Olefsky\u2019s case arises under it. His claim for damages does not arise from the failure to file EPA reports; it arises from dumping by Acme\u2019s driver in an unlined area. So what if they violated the federal reporting statute? How does that strengthen Olefsky\u2019s case? He\u2019s suing for nuisance, a state tort theory based on different acts by the defendant. It\u2019s irrelevant to Olefsky\u2019s case that they violated other federal pollution requirements. Suppose Acme had violated a federal accounting statute, and Olefsky found that out. Could he sue for his pollution claim and argue that it arises under federal law because they violated a federal law irrelevant to his claim? Certainly not. Olefsky may have alleged a federal violation in his complaint, but it doesn\u2019t  have to be in there  to state his claim against Acme. His \u2018\u2018well-pleaded complaint\u2019\u2019\u2014one that contains the allegations that entitle him to sue Acme for damages, but  only  those allegations\u2014 would contain nuisance allegations, but nothing about the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. Indeed, Olefsky\u2019s right to recover would be exactly the same if there were no Federal Toxics Transportation Act. If that is true, the statute is obviously irrelevant to his claim, and throwing promiscuous references to it into the complaint will not make the case \u2018\u2018arise under\u2019\u2019 federal law. Thus,  A  is wrong, and that means that  B  is too. If it\u2019s irrelevant that Acme violated the statute, it\u2019s also irrelevant that Olefsky alleged that they did.  D  takes the prize. This case asserts a state tort claim and therefore does not arise under federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.",

Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad\u2019s anticipated defense) doesn\u2019t mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it\u2019s hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it\u2019s fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn\u2019t claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is \u2018\u2018We made a contract with the railroad, it didn\u2019t perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.\u2019\u2019 That is the substance of the Mottleys\u2019 position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad\u2019s reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn\u2019t  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn\u2019t make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could \u2018\u2018make a federal case\u2019\u2019 out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction.\nQuestion: Olefsky, from Florida, is diagnosed with leukemia. Testing of his well determines that it is polluted with toxic chemicals, which may have caused his disease. Officials investigate and determine that the chemicals had migrated through the ground-water from a nearby landfill run by Acme Disposal Corporation, a New York corporation with its principal place of business in Florida. The landfill is completely lined, to prevent leaching into the groundwater, but several years ago one of Acme\u2019s drivers had dumped a load outside the lined area. The investigation also revealed other problems with Acme\u2019s waste management practices. For example, Acme had violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests with the Environmental Protection Agency detailing the contents of shipments of hazardous wastes, as required by the Act. Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries. The complaint also alleges that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests (though it does not allege damages arising from those violations). Acme moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nOptions: A.  The motion will be denied if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act.B.  The motion will be denied, because Olefsky has alleged a violation of federal law in his complaint.C.  The motion will be granted, even if the case arises under federal law, because Acme\u2019s principal place of business is in Florida, so that the parties are not diverse.D.  The motion will be granted, since Olefsky\u2019s case does not \u2018\u2018arise under\u2019\u2019 federal law, as that phrase is interpreted in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. \n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The Mottleys\u2019 complaint did not have to mention federal law to state their cause of action.\n{QC 2} The Mottleys\u2019 case did not arise under federal law because they only made allegations involving federal law to rebut the railroad\u2019s anticipated defense.\n{QC 3} The court will ask what the plaintiff would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court.\n{QC 4} Olefsky is suing Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries.\n{QC 5} Olefsky\u2019s complaint also alleges that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act.\n{QC 6} The motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is being considered.\n{QC 7} The court will determine whether the case arises under federal law to decide the motion to dismiss.\n{QC 8} The case does not arise under federal law if the allegations involving federal law are superfluous.\n{QC 9} Olefsky did not have to allege that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act to state his claim for nuisance.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: To determine whether the case arises under federal law, the court will consider what Olefsky needed to plead to state his cause of action, rather than what he actually pleaded. This is based on {QC 3}, which states that the court will ask what the plaintiff would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court.\nStep 2: Based on {QC 9}, Olefsky did not have to allege that Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act to state his claim for nuisance. Therefore, the allegations involving federal law in Olefsky\u2019s complaint are superfluous.\nStep 3: According to {QC 8}, the case does not arise under federal law if the allegations involving federal law are superfluous. Since Olefsky did not have to allege federal law to state his claim, the case does not arise under federal law.\nStep 4: Since the case does not arise under federal law, {QC 7} indicates that the court will not grant the motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nStep 5: Therefore, the motion to dismiss will be denied, based on the reasoning that the case does not arise under federal law, as interpreted in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, and {QC 1}, which states that the Mottleys\u2019 complaint did not have to mention federal law to state their cause of action. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$ \n--- \n### Final Answer: \nThe final answer is: A. \n--- \n### Answer Rationale: \nThe correct answer is A.

            "context": "Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s Strawbridge  Rule: The requirement of complete diversity Very early on, the Supreme Court held that diversity jurisdiction is only proper if all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants. Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will \u2018\u2018destroy diversity.\u2019\u2019 (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the non diverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s state, to \u2018\u2018perfect diversity.\u2019\u2019) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state \u2018\u2018citizens,\u2019\u2019 but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can\u2019t have \u2018\u2018intent\u2019\u2019 the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the \u2018\u2018state citizenship\u2019\u2019 of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.",
            "question": "In which of the following cases would the federal court  lack diversity jurisdiction? (Assume in each case that the suit is for more than $75,000.)",
            "options": "A.  Madison, from Virginia, Jefferson, from Virginia, and Gerry, from Massachusetts, sue Hamilton, from New York and Franklin, from Pennsylvania. B.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices B and C.",
            "ground_truth": "Questions with double choices, like  D  here, can be excruciating. You review the answers and find one that is \u2018\u2018right.\u2019\u2019 You think you\u2019re all set, and then realize that you aren\u2019t, since two may be right. Back to the drawing board. One lesson, of course, is to read all the choices very carefully. A  is a proper diversity case (and therefore not the right answer) since no defendant is from the same state as any plaintiff.  C  is not a proper diversity case, since Adams Corporation is from the same state as Madison: Its principal place of business is in Virginia. Adams can\u2019t argue that there\u2019s diversity because it is from Delaware, where it is incorporated. The point of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1) is that the corporation is considered a citizen of  both  states, and is not diverse from a citizen of either. So we have one right answer. The tougher question is whether there is diversity jurisdiction in  B , in which Washington Corporation is not incorporated in Madison\u2019s state, and does not have its principal place of business there, but does have a substantial place of business there. The statute provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state of \u2018\u2018the\u2019\u2019 principal place of business, suggesting that only one will be chosen, even if the corporation has large establishments in several. That has been the holding of the courts. A corporation\u2014say, McDonalds, of hamburger fame\u2014may have many restaurants and a great deal of business in lots of states, but under \u00a71332(c)(1) the court must choose one as its \u2018\u2018principal\u2019\u2019 place of business. The question tells you that Washington Corporation\u2019s principal place of business is Maryland. It can\u2019t be diverse from a Marylander, but is diverse from Virginians. So  B is a good diversity case; the right answer is  C . By the way, this question suggests two useful hints about taking multiple-choice questions. \u2022 First, read the question with excruciating care. Here, it would be easy to read the question as \u2018\u2018In which cases would the court  have jurisdiction?\u2019\u2019 If you do, of course, you will get it wrong. In a lecture by an expert on the multistate bar exam (which consists solely of multiple-choice questions) the speaker described the multistate exam as \u2018\u2018an exercise in reading comprehension.\u2019\u2019 I would be willing to wager that most students get more questions wrong by failing to read carefully than they do from lack of substantive knowledge. \u2022 Second, when a question tells you something is true, take it on faith. Here, for example, don\u2019t go questioning whether Washington Corporation\u2019s large office in Virginia might be its principal place of business. Your professor is the boss in the artificial world of the exam. If she says its principal place of business is Maryland, answer the question based on that premise, whether you believe it or not.",

Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will \u2018\u2018destroy diversity.\u2019\u2019 (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the non diverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s state, to \u2018\u2018perfect diversity.\u2019\u2019) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state \u2018\u2018citizens,\u2019\u2019 but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can\u2019t have \u2018\u2018intent\u2019\u2019 the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the \u2018\u2018state citizenship\u2019\u2019 of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.\nQuestion: In which of the following cases would the federal court  lack diversity jurisdiction? (Assume in each case that the suit is for more than $75,000.)\nOptions: A.  Madison, from Virginia, Jefferson, from Virginia, and Gerry, from Massachusetts, sue Hamilton, from New York and Franklin, from Pennsylvania. B.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices B and C. Choices B and C are correct because in both choices, there is at least one plaintiff and one defendant who are citizens of the same state. Choice A is incorrect. In this choice, there are no plaintiffs and defendants who are citizens of the same state. \n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The requirement of complete diversity is that all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants.\n{QC 2} In cases involving corporations, a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.\n{QC 3} A plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the non-diverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s state, to \u2018\u2018perfect diversity.\u2019\u2019\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: To determine if the federal court lacks diversity jurisdiction, we need to examine the citizenship of the plaintiffs and defendants in each option.\nStep 2: In option A, Madison and Jefferson are both from Virginia, and Gerry is from Massachusetts. Hamilton is from New York, and Franklin is from Pennsylvania.

So, to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule to corporate parties to a diversity case, courts have to determine where a corporation\u2019s principal place of business is. Corporations conduct their business in many different ways. Most corporations are small, and are incorporated in one state and do all their business in that state. These corporations are citizens of only one state. But large corporations might have extensive activities in many states\u2014think Home Depot, or McDonalds. And some corporations will incorporate in one state, concentrate their manufacturing activities in another, and maintain their headquarters, where the corporation\u2019s high-level decisions are made, in a third. Until 2010, federal courts took several approaches to determining a corporation\u2019s principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(c)(1). Some held that the state of a corporation\u2019s headquarters is the state of its principal place of business, even if the corporation\u2019s manufacturing or service activities took place elsewhere. Other courts, however, applied a \u2018\u2018daily activities\u2019\u2019 test if a corporation\u2019s productive activities were primarily concentrated in a single state, reasoning that the corporation will be perceived as \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 in that state, since it will have the most contact with the public there. If the productive activities were widely spread among states, these courts would look to the state where the corporation has its headquarters or \u2018\u2018nerve center,\u2019\u2019 since the diffused activities would all be coordinated from that state. All of this is now interesting history, because in 2010 the Supreme Court held, in  Hertz Corp. v. Friend,  559 U.S. 77 (2010), that the corporation\u2019s principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters in all cases. After  Hertz , a corporation is citizen of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere.

There is something so  plausible  about it, isn\u2019t there? The suit is brought in the state where the plaintiffs live, so no diversity? Of course this doesn\u2019t make sense, but it threatens to distract you from the business at hand. To determine diversity, we compare the state citizenship of the plaintiffs and the defendants, not the plaintiffs\u2019 citizenship and the place where the suit is brought. If the parties are from different states, it does not matter that one of the parties is a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought. The case is a proper diversity case,  no matter what state the suit is brought in. C  should not fool any but the truly unprepared. Under  Strawbridge v. Curtiss , you can have a hundred plaintiffs from the same state, as long as no defendant is from that state. So the fact that both plaintiffs are from Texas does not defeat diversity jurisdiction. And you should have rejected  E  quickly as well. A corporation is a citizen of  both  its state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business, so we need to determine that here in order to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. D  is beguiling, because it would make a lot of sense for a court to treat Apex as local in the state where its daily productive activity is centered. Many courts did apply this approach before the Supreme Court decided  Hertz Corp. v. Friend . But that case is a Supreme Court case; its decisions are the supreme law of the land, and in  Hertz  the Court held that a corporation\u2019s principal place of business for diversity purposes is in the state where it has its central offices\u2014its headquarters from which it directs corporate operations. Here, that state is Oklahoma, so Apex is a citizen of Oklahoma and of Delaware, and there is complete diversity between it and the Texas plaintiffs.  A  takes the prize.",

            "context": "Diversity in cases involving foreign citizens Article III, \u00a72 provides that federal courts may hear not only claims between citizens of different states, but also claims between citizens of a state and \u2018\u2018foreign . . . Citizens or Subjects\u2019\u2019 (sometimes called \u2018\u2018aliens\u2019\u2019). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, \u00a72. And, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff\u2019s state, is a foreign national (an alien). For diversity purposes, a person can\u2019t be a \u2018\u2018citizen\u2019\u2019 of a state unless she is also a citizen of the United States. Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc\u2019s case if he has been \u2018\u2018admitted for permanent residence in the United States.\u2019\u2019 Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a \u2018\u2018green card\u2019\u2019), Frankel could sue him in federal court under \u00a71332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn\u2019t domiciled in one. However, he isn\u2019t an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn\u2019t apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie \u2018\u2018Cleopatra.\u2019\u2019 Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living\u2014indefinitely\u2014in England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn\u2019t an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain",

The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Assume that Toussaint has not been admitted to the United States for \u2018\u2018permanent residence.\u2019\u2019) ",

            "ground_truth": "This question should help to sort out the complexities of applying diversity to cases involving American citizens and aliens. The crux of the problem is the point made above: To be a \u2018\u2018citizen\u2019\u2019 for diversity purposes, you must be  both  a citizen of the United States and domiciled in a state. Here, Toussaint, while domiciled in Iowa, is not a citizen of Iowa, because she isn\u2019t an American citizen. She\u2019s a French national, and therefore, under Article III, \u00a72, she is an alien (\u2018\u2018a citizen or subject of a foreign country\u2019\u2019). (The exception in \u00a71332(a)(2) does not apply, because Toussaint has not been admitted for permanent residence.) So  A  is wrong. C  is wrong, too. Article III authorizes suits between citizens of a state (or, as here, of several states) and aliens. It is irrelevant that Toussaint is domiciled in Iowa; she remains a Frenchwoman until she becomes an American citizen (or is admitted for permanent residence, under \u00a71332(a)(2)). And  D  is wrong, because Gompers is not a citizen of any state. Remember that, to be a citizen of a state you must be both an American citizen and domiciled in a state. Gompers is an American citizen, but he isn\u2019t domiciled in any state, since he is living in Great Britain with the intent to remain there indefinitely. The claim against him would have to be dropped for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, go with B.",

Citizens or Subjects\u2019\u2019 (sometimes called \u2018\u2018aliens\u2019\u2019). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, \u00a72. And, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff\u2019s state, is a foreign national (an alien). For diversity purposes, a person can\u2019t be a \u2018\u2018citizen\u2019\u2019 of a state unless she is also a citizen of the United States. Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc\u2019s case if he has been \u2018\u2018admitted for permanent residence in the United States.\u2019\u2019 Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a \u2018\u2018green card\u2019\u2019), Frankel could sue him in federal court under \u00a71332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn\u2019t domiciled in one. However, he isn\u2019t an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn\u2019t apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie \u2018\u2018Cleopatra.\u2019\u2019 Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living\u2014indefinitely\u2014in England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn\u2019t an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain\nQuestion: Crandall, a citizen of Missouri, and Rizzouti, a citizen of Iowa, sue Janssen, a citizen of Vermont; Gompers, an American citizen who lived all his life in Florida but recently moved to Great Britain and plans to remain indefinitely; and Toussaint, a Frenchwoman who has moved to Iowa to take a one-year visiting professorship at the University of Iowa, hoping to get tenure there and stay. The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Assume that Toussaint has not been admitted to the United States for \u2018\u2018permanent residence.\u2019\u2019) \nOptions: A.  There is no jurisdiction over the action because Toussaint is a citizen of Iowa. B.

There is no jurisdiction over the claims against Toussaint, because she is an alien domiciled in Iowa. D.  There is jurisdiction over the entire action. E.

To determine whether there is diversity jurisdiction over the action, we need to examine the citizenship status of each defendant and whether the plaintiffs have diversity with each defendant.\n\nStep 2: Janssen is a citizen of Vermont. Since Crandall is a citizen of Missouri and Rizzouti is a citizen of Iowa, there is diversity between the plaintiffs and Janssen, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(1).\n\nStep 3: Gompers is a citizen of the United States but has moved to Great Britain and plans to remain indefinitely. Although he is a citizen of the United States, he is not domiciled in any state, as he has chosen to live abroad. Therefore, he is not a citizen of any American state.\n\nStep 4: Toussaint is a Frenchwoman who has moved to Iowa to take a one-year visiting professorship at the University of Iowa. She has not been admitted to the United States for permanent residence. As an alien, she cannot be a citizen of Iowa unless she is also a citizen of the United States. However, she has not renounced her French citizenship, and her temporary stay in Iowa does not make her a citizen of the state.\n\nStep 5: Since Toussaint is an alien and not a citizen of Iowa, there is diversity between the plaintiffs and Toussaint, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(2).\n\nStep 6: The only issue remaining is whether Gompers's presence in the case affects the diversity jurisdiction. Since Gompers is a citizen of the United States but not a citizen of any American state, he does not affect the diversity between the plaintiffs and the defendants.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, there is diversity jurisdiction over the entire action, including claims against Janssen, Gompers, and Toussaint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{D}$  There is jurisdiction over the entire action.",

            "ground_truth": "It\u2019s crucial to understand why  D  is wrong. Article III of the Constitution doesn\u2019t create federal district courts, and doesn\u2019t directly bestow any jurisdiction on them. Section 1 of Article III authorizes Congress  to create lower federal courts if it chooses to. This power to create lower federal courts (or not to) carries with it the implied authority to create them, but to authorize them to hear only some of the cases listed in Article III, \u00a72. See  Kline v. Burke Constr. Inc.,  260 U.S. 226, 233-234 (1922). In other words, Article III, \u00a72 defines the universe of cases that federal courts may potentially hear, but Congress creates the lower federal courts and can give them as much or as little of the Article III jurisdiction as it chooses to. It need not\u2014and never has\u2014bestowed all of the constitutionally permissible jurisdiction on the lower federal courts. So  D  is wrong because Article III does not directly grant jurisdiction to the federal district courts; Congress does.  A  is wrong too, because Congress cannot give the lower federal courts any jurisdiction it wants. It may only grant jurisdiction over cases within the categories listed in Article III, \u00a72, which defines the outer limits of the federal judicial power. And  B  is also wrong, because  Strawbridge,  we now know (from the  Tashire  decision), interpreted the federal diversity statute, not Article III, \u00a72. Since it is the statute, \u00a71332(a) (as interpreted by  Strawbridge ), that requires complete diversity, Congress could change it. Ironically, of course, it was really Chief Justice Marshall who established the complete diversity requirement, in  Strawbridge.  But he interpreted the diversity statute to require complete diversity, not the Constitution, and the statute may be changed by Congress. So don\u2019t blame Marshall alone for the rule; Congress hasn\u2019t changed it in two hundred years. Thus,  C  is right. Smith\u2019s bill would authorize jurisdiction based on \u2018\u2018minimal diversity.\u2019\u2019 Tashire  holds that \u2018\u2018minimal diversity\u2019\u2019 cases are proper diversity cases, within the meaning of Article III, \u00a72, so Congress could authorize federal district courts to hear them.",

Consequently, it is now clear that diversity jurisdiction exists under Article III as long as there is \u2018\u2018minimal diversity,\u2019\u2019 that is, as long as some plaintiff is diverse from some defendant. However,  Strawbridge,  which interprets the diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a), to require complete diversity, has never been overruled. 1  Nor has Congress amended \u00a71332(a) to allow diversity jurisdiction based on minimal diversity. But it  could be  changed by Congress. Recall that the jurisdiction allowed under the Constitution is not self-executing. The lower federal courts derive their jurisdiction from Congress. Congress may authorize jurisdiction over all cases described in Article III, or it may authorize the federal district courts to hear only some subset of those cases. The following example illustrates the relationship between the scope of diversity jurisdiction permissible under Article III and the Congressional grant of diversity jurisdiction to the federal district courts.The amount-in-controversy requirement As the previous section explains, the scope of diversity jurisdiction in Article III and that conveyed to the federal district courts by Congress aren\u2019t the same. The  Strawbridge  rule illustrates one situation in which the statutory grant is narrower than the constitutional authority. Another example is the amount-in-controversy requirement. Article III, \u00a72 contains no monetary restriction on diversity jurisdiction; it broadly authorizes jurisdiction over all cases between citizens of different states. Congress\u2019s grant of diversity jurisdiction to the federal district courts, however, includes an amount-in-controversy requirement, in order to keep small diversity cases out of federal court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a) (granting jurisdiction over diversity cases in which \u2018\u2018the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest or costs\u2019\u2019).

This is easier, and less imaginative, than questions that require you to apply a concept to a subtle set of facts. Analytical questions call for a higher order of reasoning than this amount-in-controversy hypo. Most professors will test your analytical skills, since they are trying to teach you to think, not memorize.

It does not expressly state whether there must be \u2018\u2018complete diversity,\u2019\u2019 or whether diversity might be satisfied if  some plaintiffs are diverse from  some  defendants.  Strawbridge v. Curtiss,  of course, held that all defendants must be diverse from all plaintiffs, but for many years it was unclear whether  Strawbridge  interpreted Article III or interpreted the statute by which Congress conveys diversity jurisdiction to the lower federal courts. If  Strawbridge  interpreted the language \u2018\u2018citizens of different states\u2019\u2019 in Article III, the complete diversity rule would be constitutionally required, and could not be changed . . . unless the Court overruled  Strawbridge  or the Constitution were amended. In  State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Tashire,  386 U.S. 523 (1967), the Supreme Court held that  Strawbridge  interpreted the diversity statute, not Article III. It further held that, for Article III purposes, a case is \u2018\u2018between citizens of different states\u2019\u2019 so long as at least one plaintiff is diverse from one defendant.

            "context": "One problem with requiring a minimum amount in controversy is that you have to know how much is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 in order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction. Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the \u2018\u2018 St. Paul Mercury  rule,\u2019\u2019 the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff\u2019s injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is \u2018\u2018to a legal certainty\u2019\u2019 worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court. It is only where her injuries or losses could not rationally support a verdict for the jurisdictional amount that her claim will be dismissed. Here\u2019s a question that probes the application of the  St. Paul Mercury rule.",
            "question": "Wanda brings a diversity action against Peroski in federal court for injuries suffered in a construction accident. As a result of the accident, Wanda suffered a badly sprained ankle. She alleges that Peroski\u2019s negligence caused the accident. However, Peroski denies that her conduct was negligent. Wanda demands $100,000 in damages for her injuries.",
            "options": "A.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent. B.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges. C.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda\u2019s damages exceed $75,000. D.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met, because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages.",
            "ground_truth": "If D were the right answer to this question, the amount-in- controversy requirement would be a dead letter. Plaintiffs would simply demand large damages in their complaints, and the federal court would have to hear their cases. Surely, federal judges are too savvy to leave it at that. The court won\u2019t simply accept the number Wanda\u2019s lawyer asks for in damages; it will look at  the actual injury Wanda has suffered,  and consider whether those injuries could rationally support a verdict over the required amount. The rule suggested by  C  also misperceives the meaning of the  St. Paul Mercury  test. It suggests that the amount requirement is only satisfied where the plaintiff will definitely recover more than $75,000. Under this test, if the plaintiff might recover more, but also might recover less, there would be no diversity jurisdiction. Under  St. Paul Mercury,  the presumption is the opposite: if the damages are in the debatable range, where a reasonable jury might award more, or might award less, the amount requirement is met. Only where it is clear, as a matter of law, that the award will be  less  is the amount requirement not met. A  can\u2019t be right either: The amount-in-controversy question is not whether the plaintiff is likely to win her case on the merits, but whether, if  she does,  she might recover more than $75,000. After all, \u00a71332(a) requires that more than $75,000 must be \u2018\u2018in controversy,\u2019\u2019 not actually recovered. If the court had to consider the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s proof of her claim in order to decide whether the amount-in-controversy requirement was met, it would not be able to decide this preliminary issue without developing the facts through discovery and litigating the merits of the case. That would be a poor rule indeed for a question of jurisdiction, which should be settled at the outset of the case. So  B  is the best answer. The court will look at Wanda\u2019s damages, a sprained ankle, and consider whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for that injury. Seems like a good case for dismissal to me, but you don\u2019t have to decide that to answer the question.",

Cite the premises used to support each reasoning step in the format: {QC #}, where # refers to the premise number.\n3. Clearly explain how each step leads to the final answer.\n4.

Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the \u2018\u2018 St. Paul Mercury  rule,\u2019\u2019 the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff\u2019s injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is \u2018\u2018to a legal certainty\u2019\u2019 worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court. It is only where her injuries or losses could not rationally support a verdict for the jurisdictional amount that her claim will be dismissed. Here\u2019s a question that probes the application of the  St. Paul Mercury rule.\nQuestion: Wanda brings a diversity action against Peroski in federal court for injuries suffered in a construction accident. As a result of the accident, Wanda suffered a badly sprained ankle. She alleges that Peroski\u2019s negligence caused the accident. However, Peroski denies that her conduct was negligent. Wanda demands $100,000 in damages for her injuries.\nOptions: A.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent. B.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges. C.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda\u2019s damages exceed $75,000. D.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met, because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages. E.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether it is likely that Wanda\u2019s damages exceed $75,000. F.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if Wanda could rationally recover more than $75,000.\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. {St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938)}\n{QC 2} If the judge concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. {St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938)}\n{QC 3} If the judge concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is \u2018\u2018to a legal certainty\u2019\u2019 worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. {St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938)}\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court must evaluate the possibility that Wanda\u2019s claim could support a recovery of more than $75,000. This is based on {QC 1}, which states that the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff\u2019s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000.\nStep 2: The court will consider whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges, as stated in {QC 2}. This is because the court must evaluate the possibility of recovery, not the likelihood of recovery.\nStep 3: The court will not consider whether it is likely that Wanda\u2019s damages exceed $75,000, as stated in option E, because this is not the standard for determining the amount-in-controversy requirement. Instead, the court will consider whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000.\nStep 4: The court will not consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent, as stated in option A, because this is not relevant to determining the amount-in-controversy requirement. Instead, the court will focus on the possibility of recovery.\nStep 5: The court will not find the amount-in-controversy requirement met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda\u2019s damages exceed $75,000, as stated in option C, because this is the opposite of the standard for determining the amount-in-controversy requirement.\nStep 6: The court will not find the amount-in-controversy requirement met simply because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages, as stated in option D, because the court must evaluate the possibility of recovery, not the amount demanded.\nStep 7: The court will find the amount-in-controversy requirement met if Wanda could rationally recover more than $75,000, as stated in option F, because this is consistent with the standard for determining the amount-in-controversy requirement.\n\nAnswer: B.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges. \n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$. \n\n### References:\n{St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.

            "context": "Aggregation of damages in diversity cases If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not.

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation.

The last choice,  D , is the most interesting here, but it isn\u2019t the right answer. Under the law of causation in tort law, Curly would probably be liable for the $60,000 in initial injuries to Larry and the additional $30,000 due to Dr. Moe\u2019s malpractice. Larry would not have suffered the malpractice if he had not been injured in the accident, so most jurisdictions would hold Curly liable for this additional loss as well as the broken leg. So, the amount requirement is met as to him. But Dr. Moe is only liable for the $30,000 in damages that he caused, so the amount requirement is not met as to him. And Larry cannot aggregate his claim against Dr. Moe with his claim against Curly. Under the traditional aggregation rules, the plaintiff must seek more than $75,000 from each defendant. And that rule has not been changed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b) (barring supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Fed. R. Civ. P. 20). A  isn\u2019t right because the amount requirement is not met by either plaintiff, and they can\u2019t be added together.  B  is no good either. The amount requirement must be assessed based only on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, without regard to the value of any counterclaim. If Curly had brought the initial suit (and the claim for $100,000 were colorable), the court would have had jurisdiction. But Larry brought it, and sues for less, so his claim does not support original jurisdiction. The claims in  C  do satisfy the amount requirement, however.

            "context": "The  Grable  problem: State law claims that require proof of federal law. Under Mottley, the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises \u2018\u2018under the law that creates the cause of action.\u2019\u2019 The Mottleys\u2019 claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn\u2019t that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action still \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation\u2019s powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title\u2014a state law property claim\u2014to recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law\u2014the type of notice required by the federal statute\u2014in order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be \u2018\u2018substantial,\u2019\u2019 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies \u2014such as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court. After Grable , federal courts must make sensitive judgments about the importance of the embedded federal issue, and such issues will sometimes, but not always, support arising-under jurisdiction. If this standard appears murky, it is, but perhaps has to be to accommodate the various interests at stake in such cases.

This case is not like Grable, because the Mottleys do not have to prove any proposition of federal law to establish their claim. All they need to prove is that they had a contract and that the railroad has failed to perform it. (So C is wrong.) There is no federal issue embedded in their claim. The federal statute will be raised as a defense by the railroad. After Grable, as before, courts still look only to the plaintiff\u2019s case to determine whether the case arises under federal law. The plaintiffs\u2019 case here does not require any allegation or proof of a proposition of federal law. B is also wrong, because even if the applicability of the new federal statute is a substantial question of federal law, it is not one that the Mottleys must establish to prove their claim\u2014the railroad must prove it to establish a defense. D is wrong too. The federal court need not decide whether the statute bars renewal . . . in fact, it can\u2019t decide that, because it doesn\u2019t have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.

Under Mottley, the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises \u2018\u2018under the law that creates the cause of action.\u2019\u2019 The Mottleys\u2019 claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn\u2019t that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action still \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation\u2019s powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title\u2014a state law property claim\u2014to recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law\u2014the type of notice required by the federal statute\u2014in order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be \u2018\u2018substantial,\u2019\u2019 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies \u2014such as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court.

            "context": "The relation between constitutional and statutory limits on \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction. Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1 , which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley \u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States , 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the  Mottley  rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since  Osborn,  Congress has never repudiated  Mottley,  because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.",

The facts here are essentially a clone of  Mottley.  The plaintiff sues under state contract law, and the defendant asserts a federal defense to the claim. This is clearly not an arising-under case under the  Mottley  interpretation of \u00a71331, because the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded complaint asserts only a state law claim. So  A  and  B  are both wrong: In order to satisfy the arising-under statute, \u00a71331, the plaintiff herself must assert a right to relief under federal law, and Eleanor\u2019s claim is based on state contract law. 1  And since, under Mottley,  the court will only look at the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, not at the answer, in determining whether it has jurisdiction under \u00a71331,  D  is wrong as well. The defendant\u2019s federal defense in his answer will be disregarded in evaluating the court\u2019s jurisdiction, even if the answer is already before the court when it determines the jurisdiction question. So  C  is the right answer. The case is within the constitutional grant of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III: Franklin\u2019s federal law defense makes federal law an \u2018\u2018ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case, even though that ingredient is injected by the defendant, not the plaintiff. But the case is not proper under \u00a71331, because  Mottley \u2019s well-pleaded complaint rule (still the governing interpretation of \u00a71332(a)) requires that the plaintiff rely on federal law to make her claim.",

This case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, but not as it is construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution.  B.  This case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in both 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 and in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution. C.  This case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution, but not as construed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. D.  This case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in both 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 and in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution, if the case is removed to federal court after the defendant has answered the complaint in state court, asserting his federal defense.\n\n### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law.\n{QC 2} 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language as Article III, \u00a72.\n{QC 3} The Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\n{QC 4} Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court.\n{QC 5} The Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley \u2019s construction of the arising-under statute.\n{QC 6} In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States, Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: The phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute (28 U.S.C. \u00a71331) focuses solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, as per the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation. This indicates that the statutory interpretation is narrower than the constitutional interpretation.\nStep 2: Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution grants jurisdiction over cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law to all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. This implies that the constitutional interpretation is broader than the statutory interpretation.\nStep 3: The Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley \u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. This suggests that the constitutional interpretation is more expansive than the statutory interpretation.\nStep 4: In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States, Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. This implies that the constitutional interpretation includes cases where a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim.\nStep 5: Eleanor sues Franklin for breach of contract, claiming that he agreed to sell her certain high-risk securities on January 1, 2011, but failed to deliver them on the appointed date. Franklin defends on the ground that after he agreed to the sale, but before the delivery date, a federal statute was passed making such sales illegal. This case raises a federal issue as a defense, which is not solely focused on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\nStep 6: Since the constitutional interpretation of \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in Article III, \u00a72 includes cases where a federal issue \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case, and this case raises a federal issue as a defense, it \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution.\nStep 7: However, the statutory interpretation of \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 focuses solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and this case does not solely focus on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\nStep 8: Therefore, this case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution, but not as it is construed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{A}$",
