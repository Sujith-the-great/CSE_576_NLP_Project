            "Context": "Under federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000. The state citizenship of a person—as opposed to that of a corporation—is determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The ‘‘residence’’ requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish ‘‘residence’’ in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don’t have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there ‘‘indefinitely,’’ that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her ‘‘home.’’ She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn’t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn’t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn’t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn’t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite ‘‘indefinite’’ intent",
            "Question": "Marla, who grew up in Montana, moved to Colorado after high school to enter a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. She wasn’t sure if she really wanted to be a stylist, but she was anxious to get away from home, and her parents agreed to foot the bill, so off she went. She figured she’d stay if she liked it, and get a job as a stylist afterwards, in Denver or elsewhere in the West (including Montana). Or she would leave the program if she didn’t like it and look for work, hopefully in Denver. She took an apartment on a six-month lease. After moving to Denver, Marla",
            "Options": "A. remains domiciled in Montana, because the program is only for two years. B. remains domiciled in Montana, because she may return there to work as a stylist.  C. remains domiciled in Montana, because she was domiciled there before she left for Denver.  D. is domiciled in Colorado, because she resides there with the intent to remain indefinitely.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine Marla's domicile, we must first understand what constitutes \"domicile\" according to the given legal context. According to this context, domicile refers to the place where a person resides with the intention of remaining indefinitely.\n\n\nStep 2: Next, let's analyze Marla's situation. She moved to Colorado to attend a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. Initially, she had some uncertainty about staying in Colorado permanently, intending instead to possibly find employment as a stylist in Denver or other parts of the Western United States, including returning to her hometown in Montana.\n\n\nStep 3: We also know that Marla signed a six-month lease for an apartment in Denver. This indicates that she did intend to temporarily reside in Colorado during her studies, which aligns with her initial intentions when leaving Montana.\n\n\nStep 4: However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that Marla does indeed possess the necessary intent to remain indefinitely in Colorado. Her decision to sign a short-term lease suggests flexibility regarding her long-term residency status, implying that she might decide to extend her stay beyond the original duration of the lease.\n\n\nStep 5: Furthermore, considering Marla’s current circumstances – attending college-level courses aimed at developing skills required for professional hairstyling services within the region - strongly supports the notion that she aims to make Colorado her permanent base post-completion of education.",

            "Context": "The most fundamental point about arising-under jurisdiction is that many cases that involve federal issues do not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law. This is the essential message of that civil procedure chestnut, Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908). In Mottley, the plaintiffs sued the railroad for breach of contract, and alleged in their complaint that the railroad had breached the contract because it believed that a federal statute prohibited it from renewing their passes for free travel. In fact, when it answered the complaint, the railroad did rely on the federal statute as their justification for denying the passes. The parties then litigated that federal question and the federal trial court held that the federal statute did not bar renewing the passes. The United States Supreme Court reversed and ordered the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that a case only ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, within the meaning of the federal statute granting arising-under jurisdiction, if the plaintiff relies on federal law as the source of her right to relief. That wasn’t true in Mottley: the plaintiffs had sued for breach of contract, a state law claim. Although a federal issue was litigated, because the railroad raised a defense based on federal law, the plaintiffs did not base their claim on federal law. The fundamental premise of the Mottley rule is that we must assess the federal court’s subject matter jurisdiction based on the plaintiff’s complaint. There is no inherent reason why this must be so. Presumably, the court could wait to see whether the defendant’s answer raises defenses based on federal law, or asserts a counterclaim under federal law, and allow the court to hear the case if she does. Such later pleadings may inject important federal issues into the case, as they did in Mottley. There’s a good argument that this would be a sensible interpretation of the arising-under statute. Indeed, the American Law Institute recommended some years ago that removal be authorized where the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a federal law defense. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, §1312(a)(2) (1969). But Mottley is still a good law in the federal courts. Here’s a fairly straightforward question that illustrates the point.",
            "Question": "Consolidated Corporation sues Garces, a former employee, for business libel, a tort claim. The suit is brought in federal court, and alleges that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated was using watered-down concrete on a federal construction project. Garces answers, admitting that he had made a report to the agency, but alleging that his report was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right of free speech. He also files a counterclaim against Consolidated, based on the Federal Whistleblower Act, which authorizes damages for anyone who is dismissed or disciplined for reporting fraud on the federal government. After answering the complaint, Garces moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Assume that there is no jurisdiction based on diversity.) The motion should be",
            "Options": "A. granted, because the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the case.  B. denied, because the complaint alleges that Garces reported the violations to a federal agency.  C. denied, because the case involves a question arising under the Constitution of the United States.  D. denied, because Garces’s counterclaim arises under federal law.  E. denied, because Garces waived his objection to jurisdiction by answering the complaint and asserting a counterclaim against Consolidated.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the district court has subject-matter jurisdiction over Consolidated's lawsuit against Garces, we need to consider the allegations contained in the original complaint filed by Consolidated. According to the facts presented, Consolidated brings an action for business libel against Garces, claiming that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated used watered-down concrete on a federal construction project.\n\nStep 2: We know from the landmark decision in Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908), that a case \"arises under\" federal law only if the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates her cause of action or that the plaintiff's rights arise out of federal law. Since Consolidated's complaint does not allege any violation of federal law, its claims appear to fall outside the scope of federal-question jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: However, before dismissing the case outright, let us examine Garces' subsequent filings - specifically, his answer to the complaint and his assertion of a counterclaim under the Federal Whistleblower Act. By raising these additional matters, Garces seeks to introduce federal questions into the litigation.\n\nStep 4: Nevertheless, according to the principles established in Mottley, our assessment of subject-matter jurisdiction remains tied to the face of the original pleading. As such, even though Garces introduces federal issues through his answer and counterclaim, those assertions cannot retroactively confer jurisdiction upon the court.",

            "Context": "The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court’s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. §1441(a) provides that ‘‘any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction’’ may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, §2? If not, it can’t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here’s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.",
            "Question": "Castor Chemical Company, a California company, sues Pollux, from California, in state court for breach of contract, claiming that Pollux agreed to manufacture a drug for Castor and then reneged. Pollux answers the complaint, admitting that he refused to deliver the drug, and offering as an affirmative defense that he learned, after making the contract, that the drug was covered by a patent, so that, under federal patent law, he could not manufacture it without a license to do so. After answering, Pollux removed the action to federal court",
            "Options": "A. The action is properly removed, because at the time he was removed, Pollux had raised a federal law issue in his answer. B. The action is properly removed, because the case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law within the meaning of that phrase in Article III, §2. C. The action is not properly removed, because it is a federal question case, not a diversity case. D. The action is not properly removed, because the case does not ‘‘arise under’’ federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §1331.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the suit can be removed, we need to identify what type of federal jurisdiction would allow the lawsuit to originate in federal court. In this scenario, there's no indication that the dispute involves citizens of different states, nor is there mention of any specific federal statute granting exclusive jurisdiction over such claims. Therefore, we must consider whether the claim \"arises under\" federal law.\n\nStep 2: For a claim to arise under federal law, it typically means that the well-pleaded complaint rule applies; i.e., the plaintiff's allegations themselves invoke federal law. However, here, the initial complaint doesn't explicitly raise a federal question but rather focuses on a contractual dispute governed by state law. \n\nStep 3: Nevertheless, when considering removal, the focus shifts slightly since the defendant has already answered, raising a potential federal issue - namely, the applicability of federal patent law regarding manufacturing rights. This raises questions about whether the presence of a federal issue in the answer affects our assessment of removability.\n\n\nStep 4: Given these considerations, let's evaluate each option against the criteria established above:\n\n\nOption A suggests that the action is removable simply because Pollux raised a federal law issue in his answer. While true, this overlooks the requirement that the underlying claim itself needs to fit within a recognized category of federal jurisdiction before removal becomes possible.\n\n\nOption B posits that the action arises under federal law due to its connection to patent issues. Yet, the core of the dispute revolves around a contractual agreement and alleged breaches thereof, primarily subject to state law interpretation.\n\n\nOption C argues that the action isn't properly removable because it's a federal question case, not a diversity case. This seems plausible given the nature of the dispute, yet we've identified a critical distinction related to how federal issues were introduced during litigation.\n\n\nOption D asserts that the case doesn't 'arise under' federal law according to Section 1331 standards. Considering the central role played by state-law interpretations of contracts and the lack of explicit invocation of federal statutes in the complaint, this appears most accurate.",

Since the dispute involves two Californian companies, it falls outside the scope of diversity jurisdiction unless a separate basis exists.\n\nStep 2: We examine the possibility of invoking federal jurisdiction via the “arising under” clause, specifically focusing on whether the well-pled complaint invokes federal law directly. Initially, the complaint centers on a contractual disagreement governed by state law principles.\n\nStep 3: Upon reviewing the defendant's answer, where he introduces a federal patent issue concerning the right to manufacture the drug, we assess whether this development impacts the suitability of the case for removal.\n\nStep 4: Evaluating the options against the established criteria reveals that while Option A acknowledges the introduction of a federal issue in the answer, it neglects the necessity for the underlying claim to align with a valid category of federal jurisdiction prior to removal consideration.\n\nStep 5: Option B proposes that the action qualifies as an “arising under” case due to its link to patent matters. Nonetheless, the primary aspect of the controversy remains rooted in interpreting a contractual arrangement, predominantly subject to state laws.\n\nStep 6: Option C suggests that the action cannot be properly removed because it constitutes a federal question case rather than a diversity matter. Although this perspective holds merit given the nature of the dispute, it fails to account for the distinct manner in which federal concerns entered the picture throughout the proceedings.\n\nStep 7: Finally, Option D maintains that the case does not meet the requirements outlined in Section 1331 for falling under federal jurisdiction. Taking into consideration the pivotal roles played by state-law analyses of contracts and the absence of direct references to federal legislation within the initial complaint, this assertion presents the most compelling argument.\n\n---",

            "Context": "The early law of personal jurisdiction, represented by Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877), based personal jurisdiction on physical power over the defendant, at least in cases against individuals. The logic was that a court had the authority to exert physical power over a defendant within the territory of the state where the court sat. The court could order a sheriff to seize and detain the defendant if he found her within the state. So, the logic proceeded, if the sheriff asserted that authority symbolically (refers to the act of Sheriff serving legal documents to the defendant), by serving the defendant with process in the state, rather than actually arresting her, the court would acquire jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and could enter a judgment against her if she were found liable (This means that the defendant was served legal papers (such as a summons and complaint) when he/she was within the geographic boundaries of the state. When this service is done within the state, it typically establishes the court’s personal jurisdiction over the defendant.). Here’s a quick example to illustrate Pennoyer’s ‘‘presence theory’’ of personal jurisdiction.",

Mitchell did the work, but Neff left the state for California and didn’t pay Mitchell’s fee.

Neff promptly departed once more for California and has not returned to the state since. Under personal jurisdiction theory as expounded in Pennoyer, the Oregon court",

D. has jurisdiction over Neff for the fees claim, but would not have jurisdiction over him if Mitchell had sued him for a claim that arose in another state.",

However, after being served, Neff immediately departed for California and has remained outside of Oregon ever since.\n\n\nStep 3: Given that Neff's departure from Oregon occurred before the lawsuit was filed, we must consider whether the fact that he was temporarily present in the state during the time of service affects the court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over him.\n\n\nStep 4: Since Neff was served with process in Oregon while he was still within the state's borders, the court may assert its authority over him under the principles outlined in Pennoyer v. Neff. Therefore, even though Neff subsequently left the state, the initial service of process provides sufficient basis for the court to establish personal jurisdiction over him.\n\n\nStep 5: Based on these considerations, we conclude that the Oregon court indeed possesses personal jurisdiction over Neff due to the valid service of process while he was physically present in the state.",

            "Context": "The previous chapter iterates, and reiterates, that jurisdiction (When we talk about 'jurisdiction,' we're discussing whether a court has the authority to make legal decisions about a person or company.) based on a defendant’s ‘‘minimum contacts’’ with the forum is limited to claims that arise out of those contacts. If a defendant conducts limited activities directed to the forum state (the term 'forum state' refers to the state where the court is located and where the lawsuit is being filed. It's the state whose courts are being asked to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant.), it is subject to ‘‘specific’’ personal jurisdiction for claims arising out of those contacts, but not for other claims that arise in other states. However, in International Shoe the Court suggested that a defendant’s contacts in the state may sometimes be so extensive that it could be sued there for any claim against it, no matter where it arose. ‘‘[T]here have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.’’ 326 U.S at 318. The premise behind general in personam jurisdiction is that, where a defendant’s contacts are sufficiently extensive in the forum state, it is neither unfair nor inconvenient to require it to defend any lawsuit there, including ones that arise in other states. Thus, if International Shoe is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Missouri, it could be sued there for unemployment taxes due in Washington, or breach of a contract in Colorado. This is analogous to general in personam jurisdiction over an individual defendant based on her domicile in the state. In Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457 (1940), the Supreme Court affirmed that a person’s domicile is such an important connection to a state, and confers sufficient benefits, that an individual domiciled in a state may fairly be required to defend any claim in that state. Let’s start by distinguishing assertions of general in personam jurisdiction from other exercises of jurisdiction. Consider the following question.",

Johnston brings an action in New Mexico against Moreno, a Texas citizen, for breach of a contract they entered into in Texas, in which Moreno agreed to sell Johnston a painting. He obtains jurisdiction by attaching a time share Moreno owns at a condominium complex in the New Mexico mountains. B. Truscott sues Mancini Motors, a Texas corporation that sells antique cars at its dealerships in Texas and California. Truscott sues in New Mexico, for injuries he suffered in New Mexico while driving a 1964 Ford Mustang that Mancini had advertised in New Mexico, sold to Truscott, and shipped to him in New Mexico. Truscott serves Mancini with process in the action at the Texas dealership. Mancini has no place of business in New Mexico, but sells three or four cars a year there. C.

Skilful is incorporated in Delaware, manufactures its saws in Tennessee, where its home offices are, and sells its saws to wholesalers around the United States. Its main wholesaler, Statewide Distributors, is located in Michigan. Skilful sells 40 percent of its saws to Statewide, and ships them to Statewide in Michigan. Statewide sells at least half of those saws in Michigan.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: General in personam jurisdiction allows a plaintiff to sue a defendant anywhere because the defendant has significant connections to the forum state. To determine when this type of jurisdiction applies, consider how much activity the defendant engages in within the forum state compared to their overall level of engagement across all jurisdictions.\n\n\nStep 2: Option A involves a situation where the defendant, Moreno, does not engage in any significant activities in New Mexico; his sole contact was purchasing property outside of the state. Therefore, relying solely on the fact that Moreno owned real estate in New Mexico would likely fall short of establishing the necessary minimum contacts for general in personam jurisdiction.\n\n\nStep 3: Option B presents a scenario involving Mancini Motors selling several vehicles annually in New Mexico. Although these transactions do occur regularly, they still represent a relatively small portion of the company's total sales volume. As such, asserting general in personam jurisdiction might not accurately reflect the extent of Mancini Motors' ties to New Mexico given its broader presence elsewhere.\n\n\nStep 4: Option C describes a case where Truscott files a complaint directly against Mancini Motors in Texas, seeking compensation for false statements allegedly made during a sale conducted in another state. Since both parties involved reside outside of New Mexico, and none of the events giving rise to the dispute occurred within the boundaries of New Mexico, invoking general in-personam jurisdiction here seems inappropriate.\n\n\nStep 5: Option D portrays a situation where Skilful Electric Tool Company maintains strong commercial relationships with various entities throughout multiple regions nationwide, yet primarily focuses manufacturing efforts in Tennessee. Given that most of its products pass through intermediaries before reaching customers like Cartwright, who purchased the product in Michigan after receiving it via shipment from the primary distributor also situated in Michigan, applying general in-personam jurisdiction appears more reasonable than in scenarios described above.",

            "Context": "Let’s start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court’s power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property ‘‘without due process of law,’’ that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it’s a court that’s doing the depriving—by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it—basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have ‘‘a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction’’ over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being ‘‘at home’’ in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That’s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (‘‘No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.’’) It says to the states, ‘‘go ahead, define your courts’ jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don’t overreach.’’ It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant’s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps. First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant. Second, if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second question: whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.",
            "Question": "Perrone, an Acadia resident, sues Margules, a Montanan, in an Acadia state court, for defamation. He claims that Margules called Acme Corporation, an Acadia company that was planning to hire Perrone, and made false and defamatory statements about his professional abilities that led Acme to decide not to hire him. Margules placed the call from her office in Montana. Assume that Acadia has a long-arm statute that authorizes personal jurisdiction over a defendant who ‘‘causes personal injury in this state by a tortious act or omission while physically present within this state.’’ Assume that this is the only statute that might authorize the Acadia court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Perrone for this claim.",
            "Options": "A. The Acadia statute authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. However, it would be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. B. The Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. In addition, it would be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. C. The Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case. However, it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case. D. Although the Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case, the court may do so because the claim arises out of her deliberate contacts with Acadia that gave rise to Perrone’s claim.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine which option is correct, we need to analyze both the statutory requirement and the constitutional constraint regarding personal jurisdiction in the given scenario.\n\n\nStep 2: We first examine whether the Acadia statute authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules. According to the problem statement, the Acadia long-arm statute allows personal jurisdiction over a defendant who \"causes personal injury in this state by a tortious act or omission while physically present within this state.\" Since Margules did not cause harm in Acadia nor was she physically present there during the alleged incident, the Acadia statute does not appear to directly apply to these facts.\n\n\nStep 3: Next, we consider the constitutional aspect. For the court's assertion of jurisdiction to comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, there needs to be a connection between Margules' actions and Acadia that makes it reasonable for the lawsuit to take place in Acadia. Given that Margules allegedly made a phone call from her office in Montana causing harm in Acadia through her words, there seems to be no direct link between Margules and Acadia that satisfies the minimum contacts required by due process.\n\n\nStep 4: Combining our findings from the statutory and constitutional analyses, since neither condition necessary for asserting jurisdiction appears satisfied - the Acadia statute doesn't cover the situation described, and even if it did, the lack of significant connections between Margules and Acadia suggests unconstitutionality under the Due Process clause - we conclude that none of the options A-D accurately describe the outcome correctly according to the strict format requested.",

Therefore, the Acadia statute does indeed seem to cover the situation described in the problem.\n\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we realize that the key issue here revolves around the concept of'minimum contacts.' While Margules did initiate a communication that had consequences in Acadia, the critical factor lies in determining whether those communications were sufficiently connected to Acadia to warrant the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\nIn this regard, several factors come into play, including the location from which Margules made the call, the target of the defamation (an Acadia-based corporation), and the overall scope of the interactions between Margules and individuals within Acadia.\n\n\nConsidering these aspects, we find ourselves drawn towards the idea that the Acadia court lacks the requisite authorization to exercise personal jurisdiction over Margules, primarily due to insufficient minimum contacts.\n\n\nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that the Acadia statute somehow applied, exercising jurisdiction over Margules would likely violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, given the absence of substantial ties between Margules and Acadia.\n\n\nTherefore, taking all these points into account, we reach the conclusion that the Acadia statute does not authorize the court to exercise jurisdiction over Margules in this case, and it would also be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment for the court to exercise jurisdiction over her on the facts of this case.\n\n\nThus, after carefully weighing the various components of the problem, we deduce that the best possible answer is:\n\n\nB.",

            "Context": "The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she’s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You’d feel the same way. ‘‘Hey, wait! This case doesn’t belong here; throw it out.’’ All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court’s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the ‘‘special appearance.’’ The defendant would ‘‘appear specially’’ for the sole purpose of objecting to the court’s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court’s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court’s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have ‘‘appeared generally,’’ waiving her special appearance and accepting the court’s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff’s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a ‘‘special appearance’’ had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court’s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there’s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant’s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn’t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should—very carefully—enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here’s a question to test the point. I’ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you’ve read the discussion above it should be easy.",

Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance.

            "Context": "The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person’s property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to tell the defendant that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called ‘‘personal service of process.’’ Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant’s home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as ‘‘constructive service,’’ as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson’s wise opinion in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property—the right to sue the bank for mismanagement—due process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in Mullane was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane held that ‘‘an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.’’ 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of Mullane, several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in Mullane did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. The question below probes what it did require.",

            "Context": "Venue in most federal actions is governed by 28 U.S.C. §1391(b), which provides: (b) Venue in general. A civil action may be brought in— (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. Note that subsections 1 and 2 are alternatives. Venue is proper in a district where either a defendant resides (if they are all residents of the state where the action is brought) or a district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. Section 1391(b)(3) is a ‘‘fallback’’ venue provision that is only available in unusual circumstances: when there is no district, anywhere in the United States, where venue would be proper under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). If the defendants all reside in the state where suit is brought, or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in some federal judicial district, or if property that is the subject of the action is found in a district, §1391(b)(3) cannot apply, because there will be at least one district in which venue is proper under §1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Note also that there is a nasty proviso in 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) that poses a trap for the unwary: The first sentence of that subsection provides that the venue options in §1391(b) apply ‘‘except as otherwise provided by law.’’ Section 1391 is a general venue statute that applies unless there is a special venue statute for the type of claim the plaintiff brings. The United States Code has many specialized venue provisions for particular types of actions. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §1402 (tort action against the United States must be brought in the district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred). If there is a special venue statute for a particular type of claim, it may be interpreted as displacing the general venue choices in §1391(b)—that is, as providing alternative, exclusive venue choices for such claims—or as providing additional venue choices for those claims, along with those in §1391(b). See generally, Wright & Miller §3803. To sort out the basics of §1391(b), try the following question. Assume for all examples in the chapter that no special venue statute applies. In answering these questions, please do refer to the venue statutes. Once again, my questions are based on the assumption that you have the Federal Rules book available, so you can refer to relevant statutes and rules, rather than memorizing them. I want to test my students’ ability to apply provisions like the venue statutes or Federal Rules, rather than their memory of them.

            "Context": "The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789. They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. §1652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law would apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress’s intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as ‘‘the RDA’’) more narrowly in Swift. Justice Story concluded that the phrase, ‘‘the laws of the several states’’ in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that ‘‘The only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,’’ Swift recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state ‘‘law’’ in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct, Swift concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court—even in Pennsylvania—to follow that decision. If it didn’t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply the common law to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn’t think of it as ‘‘Pennsylvania common law,’’ or ‘‘Georgia common law,’’ but as the common law, which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue—such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser—and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the ‘‘true rule’’ of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities.1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in Swift that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the Swift case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, ‘‘What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,’’ but rather, ‘‘what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?’’ So, under Swift, federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat. Consider the following illustration of life under the Swift regime. Assume that pre-Erie law, that is, the Swift doctrine, applies.",

He is hit by something protruding from the train, perhaps a door. He sues the Erie Railroad Company in federal court for his injuries, basing federal jurisdiction on diversity. He alleges that the Railroad owed him a duty of due care, since it was aware that trespassers routinely used the right-of-way. Pennsylvania had no statute covering the duty of care owed to a railroad trespasser, but Pennsylvania cases had held that railroads owed trespassers only a duty to avoid willful or wanton conduct.

            "Context": "The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, §2 and others that don’t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff’s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same ‘‘nucleus of operative fact.’’ In Tolman’s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, §2, as interpreted in Gibbs, to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court’s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a ‘‘federal hook’’—here, the FLSA claim—from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So Gibbs recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman’s contract claim. But in Kroger, the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can’t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in Gibbs. Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that Gibbs provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise ‘‘supplemental jurisdiction’’ over related claims in proper federal cases. Here’s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a). Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has ‘‘original jurisdiction,’’ because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the ‘‘same case or controversy.’’ And, the legislative history of §1367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the Gibbs ‘‘common nucleus of operative fact’’ test are part of the same ‘‘case or controversy.’’ So, as long as the court has a federal ‘‘hook’’—a claim properly within the federal court’s original jurisdiction—it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There’s more to §1367, but for now let’s focus on this basic purpose of §1367(a).",

Since Garabedian's defamation claim shares the same nucleus of operative fact as his §1983 claim regarding deprivation of First Amendment rights, the court has constitutional authority to hear the defamation claim.\n\nStep 3: However, having constitutional authority alone is not enough; the court must also have statutory authorization to hear the claim. This brings us to §1367(a), which grants supplemental jurisdiction over related claims in proper federal cases.\n\n\nStep 4: Given that the federal court has original jurisdiction over Garabedian's §1983 claim due to its being a federal question, §1367(a) applies, allowing the court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his defamation claim.\n\n\nStep 5: Therefore, considering both constitutional and statutory requirements, the federal court indeed has both constitutional and statutory authority to hear Garabedian's defamation claim.",

            "Context": "The plaintiff starts the ball rolling by filing a complaint, but what has to be in it? Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court’s jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) ‘‘a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is notice to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This ‘‘short and plain statement’’ requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff’s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant’s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.",

You have a right to do it. You just file the amended pleading and it supersedes (or supplements) the first. If you’re a defending party, and your answer ‘‘closes the pleadings’’ (that is, no further pleading is allowed in response to your answer), you may amend your answer once within twenty-one days after serving it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(A). If the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required—typically, the original complaint, but also an answer that asserts a counterclaim or crossclaim—the pleader may amend as a matter of course within twenty-one days after service of the opposing party’s responsive pleading (usually, the answer) or a responsive motion under Rule 12. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). Just to illustrate: Maxim serves a complaint for defamation on Ruggiero, who files an answer to the complaint and serves it on Maxim. Maxim may amend his complaint without leave of court within twenty- one days after Ruggiero serves the answer (or a motion to dismiss) on Maxim. That’s governed by subsection (a)(1)(B).

They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).) Rule 11 (from https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11) : (a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney's name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney's or party's attention. (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.",

Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1 . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2 . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3 . improper venue; 4 . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5 . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6 . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7 . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff’s claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint. A crucial point about Rule 12 pre-answer motions is that the defendant never has to make one. Making a pre-answer motion to assert these defenses is allowed, but not required. If the defendant prefers, she may raise any of these seven objections—or all of them—in her answer instead. I always snare a reasonable percentage of students on this basic point. Here’s a question that illustrates the point.",
            "Question": "Creasey sues Trinh in federal court in Florida for injuries suffered in an accident in Alabama. Trinh files an answer to the complaint, including in the answer to an allegation that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over her. The objection to personal jurisdiction",
            "Options": "A. is proper, and will be considered and decided by the court. B. is proper, as long as it was also asserted in a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). C. should be stricken, because the objection must be raised by a motion, not in a responsive pleading.D. should be stricken. Trinh waived it by failing to file a pre-answer motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (2) asserting the objection.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: According to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b), when a defendant wants to object to several claims presented in a lawsuit filed against him/her, he/she needs to do so either through a \"pre-answer\" motion or within his/her answer to the complaint. This means that there's no requirement for defendants to use both methods simultaneously.\n\n\nStep 2: In this scenario, Creasey sued Trinh in federal court in Florida for injuries sustained during an incident in Alabama. When Trinh responded to the suit, she included an argument regarding the court lacking personal jurisdiction over her. Since Trinh chose to include this objection directly in her answer rather than raising it via a separate pre-answer motion, we need to determine whether this approach complies with procedural rules.\n\n\nStep 3: As per the given information, making such an objection requires adherence to specific procedures outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, objections like those related to personal jurisdiction could have been addressed using a pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b).\n\n\nStep 4: Given that Trinh did not utilize a pre-answer motion specifically addressing the issue of personal jurisdiction prior to submitting her answer, we now examine how this impacts the validity of her assertion.\n\n\nStep 5: Based on our understanding of the applicable law, particularly focusing on the requirements surrounding pre-answer motions versus assertions within answers, we proceed to evaluate each possible outcome.\n\n\nOption A suggests that the objection to personal jurisdiction is valid regardless of its presentation format. Option B implies that presenting the same objection twice - once in a pre-answer motion and again in the answer - would still be acceptable. Option C proposes striking down the objection due to incorrect procedure since it wasn't initially brought up in a motion. Lastly, Option D indicates that Trinh missed her chance to bring forth this particular grievance by neglecting to submit a pre-answer motion focused solely on personal jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ‘‘any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.’’ In an effort to rein in discovery, the ‘‘relevant to the claim or defense of any party’’ language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ‘‘the subject matter of the pending action,’’ but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ‘‘proportionality factors’’ in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ‘‘relevant to a claim or defense in the action’’ standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff’s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants’ arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn’t admissible as evidence at a trial. ‘‘Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.’’ For example, statements that are ‘‘hearsay,’’ that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here’s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).",
            "Question": "Karim sues Precision Machine Company after she suffers a serious injury to her hand using a stamping machine manufactured by Precision. Her suit is brought after the statute of limitations (A statute of limitations, known in civil law systems as a prescriptive period, is a law passed by a legislative body to set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated.) on a strict products liability claim has expired, so her complaint alleges negligence by Precision in the design of the machine. Karim’s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such ‘‘subsequent remedial measures’’ is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff’s injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory",
            "Options": "A. is not within the scope of discovery, because evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible at trial under the relevant rules of evidence. B. is not within the scope of discovery, because it concerns events taking place after Karim’s injury, and is thus irrelevant to her claim in the action. C. would be within the scope of discovery under the earlier standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), but is not subject to discovery under the 2000 amendment to that rule. D. is within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).",

One possible reason could be that the information does not meet the relevance requirement of Rule 26(b)(1).\n\nStep 2: Next, let's examine the specific issue presented - the request for information about a safety guard installed after Karim's injury. We know that evidence of \"subsequent remedial measures\" is excluded from being admitted as evidence at trial due to public policy reasons encouraging companies to implement safety improvements without fearing they'll be held liable for not doing so sooner.\n\nStep 3: Now, we should analyze how this exclusion affects our determination of whether the requested information falls within the scope of discovery. Since the information is specifically related to actions taken after the incident, there seems to be a potential argument against its relevancy to Karim's original claim of negligence prior to the installation of the safety device.",

            "Context": "Most discovery is initiated by counsel for the litigants, who send interrogatories and requests for production of documents to opposing parties and schedule depositions of witnesses. However, Rule 26(a) also requires ‘‘automatic disclosure’’ of certain categories of information— that is, an exchange of this information among the parties without a request for it from another party. Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose • the identity of individuals ‘‘likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses’’ • copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information) and things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses • a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based • any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f). Until this meeting takes place, the parties are barred from taking discovery by other means (such as interrogatories, requests for documents, or depositions). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness’s testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness’s testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party ‘‘may use to support its claims or defenses.’’ Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal supporting evidence, but not adverse evidence. This avoids placing counsel in the position of having to review all known evidence, locate all documents that might support the other party’s case, and hand them over without a request.",

            "Context": "Remember that  Mottley is frequently referred to as the ‘‘well-pleaded complaint’’ rule, because it requires the court to consider not what the plaintiff has pleaded, but what she needed to plead  to state her cause of action. Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad’s anticipated defense) doesn’t mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it’s hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it’s fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn’t claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is ‘‘We made a contract with the railroad, it didn’t perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.’’ That is the substance of the Mottleys’ position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad’s reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn’t  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn’t make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could ‘‘make a federal case’’ out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts’ jurisdiction.",

The landfill is completely lined, to prevent leaching into the groundwater, but several years ago one of Acme’s drivers had dumped a load outside the lined area.

Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries.

            "Context": "Chief Justice Marshall’s Strawbridge  Rule: The requirement of complete diversity Very early on, the Supreme Court held that diversity jurisdiction is only proper if all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants. Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will ‘‘destroy diversity.’’ (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the non diverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff’s state, to ‘‘perfect diversity.’’) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state ‘‘citizens,’’ but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can’t have ‘‘intent’’ the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the ‘‘state citizenship’’ of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.",

Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices B and C.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: In order to establish whether there's a lack of diversity jurisdiction, we need to examine each scenario given and apply the principles outlined in the problem statement regarding the requirements for diversity jurisdiction under the Strawbridge rule.\n\n\nStep 2: For part A, let's analyze the situation where Madison, Jefferson, and Gerry bring an action against Hamilton and Franklin. We must check if all parties involved come from different states, keeping in mind the rules about corporate citizenship stated in the problem.\n\n\nStep 3: Since both Hamilton and Franklin hail from different states - New York and Pennsylvania respectively - they meet the criteria for being from distinct jurisdictions. Similarly, Madison, Jefferson, and Gerry represent three separate states - Virginia, Virginia, and Massachusetts. This satisfies the condition of having at least two parties from different states present in this lawsuit.\n\n\nStep 4: Moving forward to Part B, here Madison brings forth a claim against Lafayette who resides in Maryland along with Washington Corporation, which was established in Delaware yet operates primarily out of Maryland. It also maintains significant operations within Virginia. Given these details, we should verify how the principle concerning corporate citizenship applies in determining the existence of diversity jurisdiction.\n\n\nStep 5: As per the information presented, because Washington Corporation holds dual citizenship due to its incorporation in Delaware and operation mainly in Maryland, coupled with its substantial activities taking place in Virginia, this does not align perfectly with the conditions required for establishing diversity jurisdiction according to the stipulated guidelines.\n\n\nStep 6: Lastly, examining Case C involves Madison suing Adams Corporation, which was founded in Delaware and conducts most of its business in Virginia. To assess whether there exists sufficient grounds for asserting diversity jurisdiction, we'll consider the implications arising from the fact that Adams Corporation possesses dual-state affiliation through its establishment in Delaware and operational base in Virginia.\n\n\nStep 7: Based upon our understanding of the applicable laws governing corporate citizenship, when considering Adams Corporation's status as a resident of both Delaware and Virginia, this circumstance fails to fulfill the necessary prerequisites set forth in the Strawbridge decision for achieving diversity jurisdiction.",

            "Context": "Congress has provided that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state of its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). So, to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule to corporate parties to a diversity case, courts have to determine where a corporation’s principal place of business is. Corporations conduct their business in many different ways. Most corporations are small, and are incorporated in one state and do all their business in that state. These corporations are citizens of only one state. But large corporations might have extensive activities in many states—think Home Depot, or McDonalds. And some corporations will incorporate in one state, concentrate their manufacturing activities in another, and maintain their headquarters, where the corporation’s high-level decisions are made, in a third. Until 2010, federal courts took several approaches to determining a corporation’s principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1). Some held that the state of a corporation’s headquarters is the state of its principal place of business, even if the corporation’s manufacturing or service activities took place elsewhere. Other courts, however, applied a ‘‘daily activities’’ test if a corporation’s productive activities were primarily concentrated in a single state, reasoning that the corporation will be perceived as ‘‘local’’ in that state, since it will have the most contact with the public there. If the productive activities were widely spread among states, these courts would look to the state where the corporation has its headquarters or ‘‘nerve center,’’ since the diffused activities would all be coordinated from that state. All of this is now interesting history, because in 2010 the Supreme Court held, in  Hertz Corp. v. Friend,  559 U.S. 77 (2010), that the corporation’s principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters in all cases. After  Hertz , a corporation is citizen of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties.",

Apex is a corporation that manufactures lawnmowers. It is incorporated in Delaware. It assembles the mowers at its plant in El Paso, Texas, which employs five hundred employees. It has another factory in Tennessee, which manufactures handles for the mowers and employs twenty-five employees.

C.  is not complete diversity because both plaintiffs are from Texas. D.  is not complete diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex. Under 28 U.S.C. §1332(c)(1) Texas is Apex’s principal place of business, because Texas citizens in El Paso will think of Apex as ‘‘local,’’ while hardly anyone in Oklahoma will know anything about Apex Corporation, which has very low visibility in Oklahoma. E.  is diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex, because Apex is a citizen of Delaware based on its incorporation there.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To solve this problem we need to first identify what makes up \"complete diversity\" in a lawsuit filed in a US Federal Court. Complete diversity requires that each plaintiff must be a citizen of a different state than each defendant. In other words, no two individuals involved in the suit may share citizenship of the same state.\n\n\nStep 2: We then examine the given scenario - Angus and Phillips, who are both from Texas, bringing a breach-of-contract claim against Apex Corporation in the federal district court for the Western District of Texas. Since they are both Texans, they cannot meet the requirement of being diverse from Apex Corporation regarding their shared citizenship status.\n\n\nStep 3: Next, let's consider the nature of Apex Corporation itself. According to the information provided, Apex is a corporation that was incorporated in Delaware but conducts significant operations in multiple locations including Texas, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. However, when considering the location of a corporation's 'principal place of business' for the purpose of establishing diversity jurisdiction, the key factor is typically considered to be the location of the company's headquarters rather than merely where production occurs.\n\n\nStep 4: Given that Apex's headquarters occupies a small suite of offices on the twelfth floor of an office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma, we should recognize that Apex's principal place of business falls within the State of Oklahoma according to recent judicial precedent established after the landmark decision in Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77 (2010).\n\n\nStep 5: Therefore, despite the fact that Apex also maintains facilities in various other jurisdictions such as Texas and Tennessee, the critical consideration here revolves around identifying the specific state associated with Apex's operational hub – namely, Oklahoma.",

            "Context": "Diversity in cases involving foreign citizens Article III, §2 provides that federal courts may hear not only claims between citizens of different states, but also claims between citizens of a state and ‘‘foreign . . . Citizens or Subjects’’ (sometimes called ‘‘aliens’’). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, §2. And, 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff’s state, is a foreign national (an alien). For diversity purposes, a person can’t be a ‘‘citizen’’ of a state unless she is also a citizen of the United States. Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc’s case if he has been ‘‘admitted for permanent residence in the United States.’’ Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as ‘‘local’’ in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a ‘‘green card’’), Frankel could sue him in federal court under §1332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn’t domiciled in one. However, he isn’t an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn’t apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie ‘‘Cleopatra.’’ Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living—indefinitely—in England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn’t an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain",

Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the ‘‘ St. Paul Mercury  rule,’’ the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff’s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff’s injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is ‘‘to a legal certainty’’ worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court. It is only where her injuries or losses could not rationally support a verdict for the jurisdictional amount that her claim will be dismissed.

            "Context": "Aggregation of damages in diversity cases If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ‘‘aggregation’’ problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot ‘‘aggregate’’ claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a ‘‘common, undivided interest.’’ (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. §1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.",

Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000.",

If the combined value exceeds the jurisdictional limit, the case may proceed in federal court despite initial concerns about meeting the threshold.\n\n\nStep 4: Considering Scenario C involving multiple plaintiffs and defendants across different jurisdictions, we evaluate whether the aggregate amount claimed satisfies the jurisdictional requirement.

            "Context": "The  Grable  problem: State law claims that require proof of federal law. Under Mottley, the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §1331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises ‘‘under the law that creates the cause of action.’’ The Mottleys’ claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn’t that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff’s cause of action still ‘‘arises under’’ federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation’s powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title—a state law property claim—to recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law—the type of notice required by the federal statute—in order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. §1331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be ‘‘substantial,’’ 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies —such as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court. After Grable , federal courts must make sensitive judgments about the importance of the embedded federal issue, and such issues will sometimes, but not always, support arising-under jurisdiction. If this standard appears murky, it is, but perhaps has to be to accommodate the various interests at stake in such cases. Here is a question to test your understanding of this problematic exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule.",

            "Context": "The relation between constitutional and statutory limits on ‘‘arising under’’ jurisdiction. Article III, §2 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases ‘‘arising under’’ federal law. And 28 U.S.C. §1331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase ‘‘arising under federal law’’ in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff’s complaint, shouldn’t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, §2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated’s in Question 1 , which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley ’s construction of the arising-under statute. In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States , 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of the case. Certainly, federal law ‘‘forms an ingredient’’ of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the  Mottley  rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. §1331. Although this has been clear since  Osborn,  Congress has never repudiated  Mottley,  because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under §1331, consider the following question.",
            "Question": "Eleanor sues Franklin for breach of contract, claiming that he agreed to sell her certain high-risk securities on January 1, 2011, but failed to deliver them on the appointed date. Franklin defends on the ground that after he agreed to the sale, but before the delivery date, a federal statute was passed making such sales illegal.",
            "Options": "A.  This case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is construed in 28 U.S.C. §1331, but not as it is construed in Article III, §2 of the United States Constitution.  B.  This case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is construed in both 28 U.S.C. §1331 and in Article III, §2 of the United States Constitution. C.  This case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is construed in Article III, §2 of the United States Constitution, but not as construed in 28 U.S.C. §1331. D.  This case ‘‘arises under’’ federal law as that phrase is construed in both 28 U.S.C. §1331 and in Article III, §2 of the United States Constitution, if the case is removed to federal court after the defendant has answered the complaint in state court, asserting his federal defense",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand what \"arising under\" jurisdiction entails according to both Article III, §2 of the US Constitution and 28 USC §1331. According to Article III, §2, federal courts may hear cases 'arising under' federal law, whereas 28 USC §1331 grants jurisdiction to federal district courts when there is a claim arising under federal law.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's analyze how these two provisions differ in interpreting the term \"arising under.\" While the statute focuses solely on the plaintiff's complaint, the Constitutional provision has been interpreted more broadly by the Supreme Court in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, indicating that federal law forms an essential part of the case even if raised as a defense or counterclaim.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering Eleanor suing Franklin for breach of contract due to non-delivery of high-risk securities, where Franklin defends on grounds that post-agreement, a federal statute made such sales illegal, we must apply our understanding of \"arising under\" jurisdiction to this scenario.\n\nStep 4: Given that Franklin's defense relies on a federal statute, it indicates that federal law plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the case. Therefore, applying the broader interpretation of Article III, §2, this case indeed arises under federal law.",

            "verification_questions": [
                "--1 In Step 1: Does the similarity in wording between Article III, §2 and 28 USC §1331 necessarily imply identical meanings?",
                "--2 In Step 2: Is it correct to assume that the Supreme Court's narrower interpretation of \"arising under\" in 28 USC §1331 directly influences its interpretation of the same phrase in Article III, §2?",
                "--3 In Step 3: Are the implications of restricting federal court jurisdiction through the Mottley rule adequately considered in the context of Article III"
            ],
            "updated_reasoning": ": Step 1: We first acknowledge the differing interpretations of \"arising under\" jurisdiction between Article III, §2 of the Constitution and 28 USC §1331. Specifically, the latter construes it narrowly focusing on the plaintiff's complaint, whereas the former has been interpreted more expansively by the Supreme Court in Osborn v. Bank of the United States. Step 2: Applying the broader interpretation afforded by Article III, §2 to the scenario presented, we observe that Franklin's defense centers around a federal statute outlawing the sale of high-risk securities. As per the expansive view, this makes the case qualify as \"arising under\" federal law. Step 3: Recognizing the discrepancy between the standards set by Article III, §2 and those specified in 28 USC §1331, particularly regarding the inclusion of cases featuring federal defenses and counterclaims, leads us to infer that the present instance fails to comply with the tighter requirements stipulated in the statute. Step 4: Based on the differentiation highlighted and applied to the particular circumstances described, the most fitting representation of the interplay between constitutional and statutory limitations on \"arising under\" jurisdiction corresponds to option C. ---",
