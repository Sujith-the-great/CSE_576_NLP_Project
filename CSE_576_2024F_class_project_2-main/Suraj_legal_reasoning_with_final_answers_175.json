            "Context": "State citizenship in diversity cases: The domicile test Under federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000. The state citizenship of a person�as opposed to that of a corporation�is determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The ��residence�� requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish ��residence�� in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don�t have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there ��indefinitely,�� that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her ��home.�� She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn�t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn�t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn�t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn�t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite ��indefinite�� intent.",
            "Question": "1. Moving Marla.  Marla, who grew up in Montana, moved to Colorado after high school to enter a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. She wasn�t sure if she really wanted to be a stylist, but she was anxious to get away from home, and her parents agreed to foot the bill, so off she went. She figured she�d stay if she liked it, and get a job as a stylist afterwards, in Denver or elsewhere in the West (including Montana).

            "Context": "Chief Justice Marshall�s  Strawbridge  Rule: The requirement of complete diversity Very early on, the Supreme Court held that diversity jurisdiction is only proper if all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants. Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will ��destroy diversity.�� (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the nondiverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff�s state, to ��perfect diversity.��) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state ��citizens,�� but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can�t have ��intent�� the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the ��state citizenship�� of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.",
            "Question": "3. Foundering fathers.  In which of the following cases would the federal court  lack diversity jurisdiction? (Assume in each case that the suit is for more than $75,000.)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Madison, from Virginia, Jefferson, from Virginia, and Gerry, from Massachusetts, sue Hamilton, from New York and Franklin, from Pennsylvania. B.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices  B  and  C .",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of diversity jurisdiction and the requirements set forth in the Strawbridge v. Curtiss decision. We'll examine each scenario individually to see whether there's complete diversity between the parties involved.\n\n\nStep 2: For Option A, we're looking at three plaintiffs - Madison, Jefferson, and Gerry - suing two defendants - Hamilton and Franklin. Since Madison and Jefferson share the same state of origin (Virginia), they don't meet the criteria for complete diversity because not all plaintiffs are from different states from all defendants.\n\n\nStep 3: Moving on to Option B, Madison is suing Lafayette and Washington Corporation. Here, Madison is from Virginia, Lafayette is from Maryland, and Washington Corporation is both incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Maryland. This means that Washington Corporation shares the same state of incorporation and principal place of business as Lafayette, making them essentially the same entity under the law. Therefore, even though Madison comes from a different state, he doesn't satisfy the condition of being diverse from either party due to the shared connection through Washington Corporation.\n\n\nStep 4: Now let's consider Option C where Madison is suing Adams Corporation. Given that Adams Corporation was incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Virginia, just like Madison, these entities share commonality in terms of state of incorporation and principal place of business. As such, Madison does not fulfill the necessary criterion of having his home state differ from those of the corporate defendants.\n\n\nStep 5: Based on our examination above, Options B and C fail to demonstrate sufficient diversity among the litigants required for federal court jurisdiction.",

            "Context": "Determining a corporation�s principal place of business Congress has provided that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state of its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1). So, to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule to corporate parties to a diversity case, courts have to determine where a corporation�s principal place of business is. Corporations conduct their business in many different ways. Most corporations are small, and are incorporated in one state and do all their business in that state. These corporations are citizens of only one state. But large corporations might have extensive activities in many states�think Home Depot, or McDonalds. And some corporations will incorporate in one state, concentrate their manufacturing activities in another, and maintain their headquarters, where the corporation�s high-level decisions are made, in a third. Until 2010, federal courts took several approaches to determining a corporation�s principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1). Some held that the state of a corporation�s headquarters is the state of its principal place of business, even if the corporation�s manufacturing or service activities took place elsewhere. Other courts, however, applied a ��daily activities�� test if a corporation�s productive activities were primarily concentrated in a single state, reasoning that the corporation will be perceived as ��local�� in that state, since it will have the most contact with the public there. If the productive activities were widely spread among states, these courts would look to the state where the corporation has its headquarters or ��nerve center,�� since the diffused activities would all be coordinated from that state. All of this is now interesting history, because in 2010 the Supreme Court held, in  Hertz Corp. v. Friend,  559 U.S. 77 (2010), that the corporation�s principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters in all cases. After  Hertz , a corporation is citizen of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties.",
            "Question": "5. Business principals.  Angus and Phillips, from Texas, bring a breach of contract action against Apex Corporation in the federal district court for the Western District of Texas. Apex is a corporation that manufactures lawnmowers. It is incorporated in Delaware. It assembles the mowers at its plant in El Paso, Texas, which employs five hundred employees. It has another factory in Tennessee, which manufactures handles for the mowers and employs twenty-five employees. Its corporate headquarters occupy a small suite of offices on the twelfth floor of an office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fifteen officers and employees work out of the headquarters office. The court will find that there",

B.  is not complete diversity because the case is brought in a Texas court, and the plaintiffs are both Texas citizens. C.  is not complete diversity because both plaintiffs are from Texas. D.  is not complete diversity between the plaintiffs and Apex. Under 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1) Texas is Apex�s principal place of business, because Texas citizens in El Paso will think of Apex as ��local,�� while hardly anyone in Oklahoma will know anything about Apex Corporation, which has very low visibility in Oklahoma.

            "Context": "Diversity in cases involving foreign citizens Article III, �2 provides that federal courts may hear not only claims between citizens of different states, but also claims between citizens of a state and ��foreign . . . Citizens or Subjects�� (sometimes called ��aliens��). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, �2. And, 28 U.S.C. �1332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. �1332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff�s state, is a foreign national (an alien). For diversity purposes, a person can�t be a ��citizen�� of a state unless she is also a citizen of the United States. Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc�s case if he has been ��admitted for permanent residence in the United States.�� Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as ��local�� in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a ��green card��), Frankel could sue him in federal court under �1332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn�t domiciled in one. However, he isn�t an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn�t apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie ��Cleopatra.�� Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living�indefinitely�in England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn�t an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain.",
            "Question": "6. At home and abroad.  Crandall, a citizen of Missouri, and Rizzouti, a citizen of Iowa, sue Janssen, a citizen of Vermont; Gompers, an American citizen who lived all his life in Florida but recently moved to Great Britain and plans to remain indefinitely; and Toussaint, a Frenchwoman who has moved to Iowa to take a one-year visiting professorship at the University of Iowa, hoping to get tenure there and stay. The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Assume that Toussaint has not been admitted to the United States for ��permanent residence.��)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  There is no jurisdiction over the action because Toussaint is a citizen of Iowa. B.  There is no jurisdiction if Gompers remains in the case, but the action could proceed between the plaintiffs Crandall and Rizzouti and defendants Toussaint and Janssen. C.  There is no jurisdiction over the claims against Toussaint, because she is an alien domiciled in Iowa. D.  There is jurisdiction over the entire action.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand what constitutes a valid claim under diversity jurisdiction. According to Article III, §2, federal courts may hear claims between citizens of different states or between citizens of a state and aliens. Additionally, 28 U.S.C. §1332(a)(2) specifically authorizes federal district courts to hear cases where an alien is involved.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's examine each party's status regarding their connection to the United States and its various states. We know that Crandall is a citizen of Missouri, Rizzouti is a citizen of Iowa, Janssen is a citizen of Vermont, Gompers is an American citizen residing in Great Britain, and Toussaint is a French woman temporarily working in Iowa.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering these statuses, we should determine whether each party qualifies as a 'citizen' of a particular state for diversity jurisdiction purposes. As per the given information, a person needs to meet two conditions - they must be a US citizen and be domiciled in a specific state.\n\nStep 4: Based on our understanding, we find that Gompers does not qualify as a citizen of any state due to his indefinite residency outside the country. Similarly, Toussaint, despite being temporarily employed in Iowa, would not be considered a citizen of Iowa solely based on her temporary presence.\n\nStep 5: Given these considerations, we conclude that the key factor determining the validity of the lawsuit lies in the parties' connections to the respective states.",

Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the �� St. Paul Mercury  rule,�� the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff�s claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff�s injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is ��to a legal certainty�� worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court.

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ��aggregation�� problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot ��aggregate�� claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a ��common, undivided interest.�� (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. �1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. �1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at  Chapter 14 , pp.  279 - 283.

He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith�s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe�s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state.

He claims that Curly caused the accident, and that he suffered $60,000 in damages from a broken leg suffered in the accident. He further claims that Dr. Moe negligently set the leg after the accident, causing an additional $30,000 in damages.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether all the claims can properly be brought in federal court under the given options, we need to consider the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, including the citizenship of the parties involved and the amount in controversy.\n\nStep 2: Option A involves Larry and Moe suing Curly for negligence. Here, there is no diversity since all three individuals are from different states - Larry and Moe are from New York, but Curly is from Iowa. However, the amount in controversy ($85,000 total) exceeds the threshold of $75,000, suggesting that this case may meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Moving to Option B, where Larry sues Curly with a counterclaim, we have complete diversity since Larry is from New York and Curly is from Iowa. Additionally, the combined value of the original claim and the counterclaim exceeds the minimum amount in controversy, meeting another key criterion for diversity jurisdiction.\n\nStep 4: Examining Option C, Larry's suit against Curly and Moe presents a situation without complete diversity due to the presence of multiple defendants who share the same state of residence (Iowa). This scenario fails to fulfill the necessary conditions for diversity jurisdiction.\n\nStep 5: Finally, considering Option D, Larry brings a lawsuit against Curly and Dr. Moe, again involving non-diverse parties since both Curly and Dr. Moe reside in Iowa.

            "Context": "The toughest nut: The  Mottley  rule The most fundamental point about arising-under jurisdiction is that many cases that involve federal issues do not ��arise under�� federal law. This is the essential message of that civil procedure chestnut,  Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley,  211 U.S. 149 (1908). In  Mottley , the plaintiffs sued the railroad for breach of contract, and alleged in their complaint that the railroad had breached the contract because it believed that a federal statute prohibited it from renewing their passes for free travel. In fact, when it answered the complaint, the railroad did rely on the federal statute as their justification for denying the passes. The parties then litigated that federal question and the federal trial court held that the federal statute did not bar renewing the passes. The United States Supreme Court reversed and ordered the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that a case only ��arises under�� federal law, within the meaning of the federal statute granting arising-under jurisdiction, if the  plaintiff relies  on federal law as the source of her right to relief. That wasn�t true in  Mottley : the plaintiffs had sued for breach of contract, a state law claim. Although a federal issue was litigated, because the railroad raised a defense based on federal law, the plaintiffs did not base their claim on federal law. The fundamental premise of the  Mottley  rule is that we must assess the federal court�s subject matter jurisdiction based on the plaintiff�s complaint. There is no inherent reason why this must be so. Presumably, the court could wait to see whether the defendant�s answer raises defenses based in federal law, or asserts a counterclaim under federal law, and allow the court to hear the case if she does. Such later pleadings may inject important federal issues into the case, as they did in  Mottley. There�s a good argument that this would be a sensible interpretation of the arising-under statute. Indeed, the American Law Institute recommended some years ago that removal be authorized where the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a federal law defense. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, �1312(a)(2) (1969). But Mottley  is still good law in the federal courts. Here�s a fairly straightforward question that illustrates the point.",

The suit is brought in federal court, and alleges that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated was using watered-down concrete on a federal construction project. Garces answers, admitting that he had made a report to the agency, but alleging that his report was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right of free speech. He also files a counterclaim against Consolidated, based on the Federal Whistleblower Act, which authorizes damages for anyone who is dismissed or disciplined for reporting fraud on the federal government. After answering the complaint, Garces moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Assume that there is no jurisdiction based on diversity.) The motion should be",

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the district court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the case, we need to consider the allegations made by both Consolidated and Garces. Initially, Consolidated brings an action for business libel, a tort claim, against Garces in federal court. However, the key aspect here is what Garces responds with - specifically, his assertion of a constitutional defense and filing of a counterclaim under the Federal Whistleblower Act.\n\nStep 2: According to the Mottley rule, a case only 'arises under' federal law if the plaintiff's complaint itself invokes federal law as the basis for their right to relief. Since Consolidated's original complaint does not invoke federal law, its initial claim alone cannot establish federal-question jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Furthermore, even though Garces's counterclaim does arise under federal law due to the Federal Whistleblower Act, the mere presence of such a counterclaim does not automatically confer federal-question jurisdiction upon the entire lawsuit. Instead, each party's claims must independently satisfy the requirements for federal-question jurisdiction.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, since Consolidates' primary claim does not meet the criteria established by the Mottley rule, the district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.",

            "Context": "What is a ��well-pleaded complaint?�� \nRemember that  Mottley  is frequently referred to as the ��well-pleaded complaint�� rule, because it requires the court to consider not what the plaintiff has pleaded, but what she  needed to plead  to state her cause of action. Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad�s anticipated defense) doesn�t mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it�s hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it�s fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn�t claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is ��We made a contract with the railroad, it didn�t perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.�� That is the substance of the Mottleys� position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad�s reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn�t  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn�t make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could ��make a federal case�� out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts� jurisdiction.

The landfill is completely lined, to prevent leaching into the groundwater, but several years ago one of Acme�s drivers had dumped a load outside the lined area. The investigation also revealed other problems with Acme�s waste management practices. For example, Acme had violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act, by failing to file manifests with the Environmental Protection Agency detailing the contents of shipments of hazardous wastes, as required by the Act. Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries.

            "Context": "State law claims that require proof of federal law. Under  Mottley , the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case ��arises under�� federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. �1331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises ��under the law that creates the cause of action.�� The Mottleys� claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn�t that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff�s cause of action still ��arises under�� federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation�s powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title�a state law property claim�to recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law�the type of notice required by the federal statute�in order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. �1331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be ��substantial,�� 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies �such as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court. After  Grable , federal courts must make sensitive judgments about the importance of the embedded federal issue, and such issues will sometimes, but not always, support arising-under jurisdiction. If this standard appears murky, it is, but perhaps has to be to accommodate the various interests at stake in such cases. Here are two questions to test your understanding of this problematic exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule.",

D.  grant the motion only if it concludes that the federal statute does not bar renewal of the Mottleys� passes.",

This rule holds that a defendant may remove a civil action filed in state court to federal court only if the plaintiff's complaint alleges a claim that arises under federal law.\n\n\nStep 2: Since the Mottleys assert a state-law claim for breach of contract, the well-pleaded complaint rule suggests that removal to federal court might not be proper unless the claim satisfies the requirements for arising-under jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n\nStep 3: Arising-under jurisdiction requires that the claim before the court arise under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. We then turn our attention to the specific circumstances surrounding the Mottleys' claim to decide whether it meets these criteria.\n\n\nStep 4: According to the facts presented, the Mottleys were initially given free passes on the railroad due to an agreement between them and the railroad company. These passes included a provision releasing the railroad from liability for accidents occurring during travel using the pass.\n\n\nStep 5: When the Mottleys sought to renew their passes, however, they were informed that the railroad could no longer honor those agreements due to changes made by Congress through a newly enacted federal statute.\n\n\nStep 6: As part of their lawsuit, the Mottleys argue that the application of the new federal statute should not extend retroactively to affect their existing contracts, which predated the legislation.\n\n\nStep 7: Given this scenario, we now apply the principles outlined in Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co., 545 U.S. 308 (2005) to assess whether the Mottleys' claim qualifies as arising under federal law.\n\n\nStep 8: In Grable, the Supreme Court established that a claim may qualify as arising under federal law when resolution of the state-law claim necessarily turns on a substantial question of federal law.\n\n\nStep 9: Applying this precedent to the present situation reveals that determining whether the federal statute bars the Mottleys' renewed passes involves interpreting the scope and applicability of the federal legislation relative to their original contractual arrangements.\n\n\nStep 10: Therefore, resolving the dispute hinges upon establishing a significant aspect of federal statutory construction, specifically addressing how far back the prohibition extends.\n\n\nStep 11: Based on the above considerations, we conclude that the Mottleys' claim indeed presents a substantial question regarding the interpretation of federal law, thereby satisfying the conditions necessary for arising-under jurisdiction.\n\n\nStep 12: Consequently, despite being framed within a state-law framework, the underlying controversy necessitates consideration of a material point of federal law, thus supporting the exercise of federal judicial power.\n\n\n---",

Their claim centers around the denial of renewal of their free passes, alleging that the Railroad breached an agreement to renew their passes for life in exchange for a release of liability related to an earlier accident. The Mottleys contend that the Railroad's refusal to renew their passes resulted from a new federal statute prohibiting free passes, yet they maintain that this statute only applies to passes granted post-enactment. The Railroad seeks dismissal of the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the claim does not meet the requirements for arising-under jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n## Step 1: Determine Whether the Claim Meets the Requirements for Arising-Under Jurisdiction\nTo resolve this issue, we must analyze whether the Mottleys' claim satisfies the standards set forth in Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co., 545 U.S. 308 (2005).\n\n## Step 2: Examine the Application of Federal Law in the Mottleys' Case\nIn Grable, the Supreme Court ruled that a claim may qualify as arising under federal law when resolution of the state-law claim necessarily depends on a substantial question of federal law.

            "final_answer": "Legal Context\nThe Mottleys bring a state law claim for breach of contract against the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company. Their claim centers around the denial of renewal of their free passes, alleging that the Railroad breached an agreement to renew their passes for life in exchange for a release of liability related to an earlier accident. The Mottleys contend that the Railroad's refusal to renew their passes resulted from a new federal statute prohibiting free passes, yet they maintain that this statute only applies to passes granted post-enactment. The Railroad seeks dismissal of the case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that the claim does not meet the requirements for arising-under jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n## Step 1: Determine Whether the Claim Meets the Requirements for Arising-Under Jurisdiction\nTo resolve this issue, we must analyze whether the Mottleys' claim satisfies the standards set forth in Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co., 545 U.S. 308 (2005).\n\n## Step 2: Examine the Application of Federal Law in the Mottleys' Case\nIn Grable, the Supreme Court ruled that a claim may qualify as arising under federal law when resolution of the state-law claim necessarily depends on a substantial question of federal law.

            "Context": "Article III, �2 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases ��arising under�� federal law. And 28 U.S.C. �1331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase ��arising under federal law�� in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff�s complaint, shouldn�t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, �2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated�s in Question 1 , which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley �s construction of the arising-under statute. In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States , 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law ��forms an ingredient�� of the case. Certainly, federal law ��forms an ingredient�� of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the  Mottley  rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. �1331. Although this has been clear since  Osborn,  Congress has never repudiated  Mottley,  because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under �1331, consider the following question.",

            "final_answer": "================================================================================================================\nHere is your legal context:\n\n\nArticle III, �2 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases ��arising under�� federal law. And 28 U.S.C. �1331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase ��arising under federal law�� in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff�s complaint, shouldn�t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, �2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated�s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than  Mottley �s construction of the arising-under statute. In  Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law ��forms an ingredient�� of the case. Certainly, federal law ��forms an ingredient�� of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the  Mottley  rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. �1331. Although this has been clear since  Osborn,  Congress has never repudiated  Mottley,  because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the onset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress�s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here�s another example to drive home the point.6. Limiting the limits.  Congressperson Smith introduces a bill to add a $75,000.01 amount-in-controversy requirement to 28 U.S.C. �1331.Options: A.  Smith�s bill would be constitutional, since Congress may expand or restrict the jurisdiction of the federal district courts as it sees fit. B.  Smith�s bill would be unconstitutional, since it would restrict the right of plaintiffs to take some cases that arise under federal law to federal court. C.  Smith�s bill would be constitutional, because Congress may grant less than the full Article III jurisdiction to the federal courts. D.  Smith�s bill would be unconstitutional, since Article III, �2 authorizes the federal district courts to hear all cases arising under federal law.Step 1: To begin solving this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Article III, �2 of the US Constitution and 28 U.S.C. �1331, the statute granting jurisdiction to the federal district courts. Both use the term 'arising under' federal law, suggesting they should convey similar meaning.\n\nStep 2: However, the Supreme Court's interpretation of the 'arising under' clause in the statute focuses solely on the plaintiff's complaint, whereas its interpretation of the same clause in Article III, �2 suggests a broader application encompassing both claims and defenses involving federal issues.\n\nStep 3: This distinction implies that even though the statute grants jurisdiction to the federal district courts, Congress hasn't exercised its discretion fully, leaving room for further limitations through legislation.\n\nStep 4: Considering these points, when evaluating whether adding a new limitation to 28 U.S.C. �1331 via Congressional action would be constitutional, we must recognize that Congress retains flexibility in defining the extent of federal judicial power within the bounds set by Article III.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, introducing a higher amount-in-controversy requirement, akin to what Congressman Smith proposes, falls within Congress's authority to shape the contours of federal jurisdiction without infringing upon the core principles outlined in Article III.--1 In Step 1: How does the similarity in wording between Article III, �2 and 28 U.S.C. �1331 necessarily imply identical meanings?\n--2 In Step 2: What evidence supports the claim that the Supreme Court interprets \"arising under\" differently in the statute versus Article III, �2?\n--3 In Step 3: Can the fact that Congress hasn't used its discretion fully regarding the statute justify assuming it will continue to leave room for future limitations?\n--4 In Step 4: Does recognizing congressional flexibility inherently validate any proposed changes to 28 U.S.C. �1331, regardless of their impact on federal judicial power?\n--5 In Step 5: Is there sufficient justification for concluding that increasing the amount-in-controversy requirement aligns with Congress's ability to define the boundaries of federal jurisdiction?\n\nNow here is your question:\n\n\nWhat is the effect of adding a $75,000.01 amount-in-controversy requirement to 28 U.S.C. �1331?\n\n\nAnd finally, here are your choices:\n\n\nOptions: A.  Smith�s bill would be constitutional, since Congress may expand or restrict the jurisdiction of the federal district courts as it sees fit. B.  Smith�s bill would be unconstitutional, since it would restrict the right of plaintiffs to take some cases that arise under federal law to federal court. C.  Smith�s bill would be constitutional, because Congress may grant less than the full Article III jurisdiction to the federal courts. D.  Smith�s bill would be unconstitutional, since Article III, �2 authorizes the federal district courts to hear all cases arising under federal law.\n\n\nPlease select the best option according to the legal context you've read above.\n\n\n\nThe Final Answer of Choice: D =================================================================================================\n\n\n### Updated Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: Adding a $75,000.01 amount-in-controversy requirement to 28 U.S.C. �1331 would indeed impose a new limit on the jurisdiction of the federal district courts.\n\nStep 2: While Congress possesses significant latitude in defining the parameters of federal jurisdiction, doing so cannot contravene the fundamental constraints imposed by Article III, �2.\n\nStep 3: Specifically, Article III, �2 mandates that federal courts possess jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law; thus, any legislative attempt to curtail this jurisdiction must be scrutinized carefully.\n\nStep 4: Introducing an amount-in-controversy requirement effectively narrows the scope of federal jurisdiction, thereby limiting the reach of Article III, �2.\n\nStep 5: Consequently, such a measure would likely violate the constitutional mandate governing federal jurisdiction, rendering Smith"

            "Context": "Our analysis of arising-under jurisdiction demonstrates that a great many cases that raise federal issues cannot be brought in federal court. Cases like  Mottley,  in which federal law is raised as a defense, or cases in which a federal law counterclaim is asserted, are not within federal court arising-under jurisdiction. So what becomes of them? They are brought in state court, of course. State courts are competent to decide issues of federal law, and in cases like these they must do so. Suppose, however, that the plaintiff has a case that is within federal arising-under jurisdiction, even as narrowly construed under 28 U.S.C. �1331, but wants to bring it in state court. Can she do that? Put another way,  must  a case be brought in federal court if it satisfies the  Mottley standard for arising-under jurisdiction? Generally, the answer is ��no.�� Most cases that arise under federal law may be brought in state court if the plaintiff prefers to do so. For example, if Isaacs has a claim under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, it clearly arises under federal law and may be filed in federal court. But Isaacs would have the right to sue in state court instead, if she prefers. If she sues under 42 U.S.C. �1983, for violation of her federal civil rights, she could certainly do so in federal court under Mottley,  but again, she doesn�t have to. The jurisdiction of the federal and state courts over most types of federal law cases is said to be ��concurrent,�� that is, the courts of both systems can entertain these cases. Like so many legal principles, this one has an exception. It has long been held that Congress may, if it chooses, provide by statute that the federal courts� jurisdiction over a particular type of federal claim is exclusive, that is, that those federal claims  must  be brought in federal court. See, e.g.,  Bowles v. Willingham,  321 U.S. 503, 511-512 (1944). Congress has mandated suit in federal court in some categories of cases. For example, 28 U.S.C. �1338(a) provides in part that ��[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents. . . .�� Occasionally, too, the Supreme Court has concluded that Congress intended federal court jurisdiction to be exclusive, even though the statute isn�t clear on the point. But this is quite rare. In most cases, jurisdiction is concurrent with the courts of the states, unless the federal statute conferring jurisdiction confines jurisdiction to the federal courts. See generally C. Wright & M.K. Kane, The Law of Federal Courts  �45 (8th ed. 2017). With this background, the following problem should be pretty easy.",

This means we need to consider whether the case at hand falls within federal arising-under jurisdiction.\n\nStep 2: Since the question mentions that Plaintiff wishes to sue Defendant under the Lanham Act, a federal statute, we understand that the case does indeed fall within federal arising-under jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: However, we also recall that most cases that arise under federal law may be brought in state court if the plaintiff prefers to do so, due to the principle of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nStep 4: Nevertheless, we note that there's an exception where Congress may provide by statute that the federal courts' jurisdiction over a particular type of federal claim is exclusive.\n\nStep 5: Given that the question asks about the possibility of suing under the Lanham Act, we realize that the key factor here is whether the Lanham Act itself restricts suits under the Act to federal court.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, considering all the above points, we conclude that if the Lanham Act itself restricts suits under the Act to federal court, then Plaintiff must file in federal court.",

Sometimes, a plaintiff may allege facts that would support a federal claim, but it is far from clear that she will be able to establish those facts. Here�s a question that considers the relationship of such factual disputes to the court�s subject matter jurisdiction. In addressing it, ignore the possibility of supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. �1367.",
            "Question": "8. Polymolysorbate.  Antril, a Florida citizen, sues Manello, from Kentucky, in federal court. She claims that Manello, a driver for Acme Disposal Corporation, negligently drove a hazardous waste truck off the road, leading to a spill that polluted Antril�s property with polymolysorbate. She also asserts a claim, in the same action, against Acme, a Florida corporation, for violation of the Federal Toxics Transportation Act (FTTA). That statute bars transporting polymolysorbate in a truck that lacks a secondary containment system, and allows recovery for resulting pollution damages. Antril�s damages are, quite probably, several hundred thousand dollars. Manello answers the complaint denying that he drove negligently. In its answer, Acme admits that the Federal Toxics Transportation Act requires secondary containment for polymolysorbate, but denies that the polymolysorbate spilled from its truck. It alleges that its truck was not carrying polymolysorbate, so it must have come from an earlier spill by a different hauler.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The federal district has jurisdiction over the entire action. B.  The federal district court has jurisdiction over the action only if Antril establishes that Acme�s truck was transporting polymolysorbate. C.  The federal district court has jurisdiction over the action against Manello, since Antril and Manello are diverse, but does not have jurisdiction over the claim against Acme, because Antril�s claim against Acme raises no disputed issue of federal law, only a factual question concerning who spilled polymolysorbate on Antril�s property. D.  The federal district court lacks jurisdiction over the suit, since Antril and Acme are both citizens of Florida and thus, under  Strawbridge,  there is no complete diversity.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to determine whether the federal district court has original jurisdiction over this case. Since Antril and Manello are diverse - they are citizens of different states - the court could exercise diversity jurisdiction over their dispute. However, before determining whether the court has jurisdiction over the entire action, including the FTTA claim against Acme, we should consider what issues remain to be resolved as fact.\n\nStep 2: We know that Antril's damage award is likely substantial, which means that her state-law negligence claim against Manello meets the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction. Therefore, the court has jurisdiction over the action against Manello.\n\nStep 3: Now let us turn our attention to the FTTA claim against Acme. For the court to have jurisdiction over this claim, either the parties' citizenships must meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, or some other basis for federal jurisdiction must exist. Because Antril and Acme share the same citizenship, however, the court cannot rely upon diversity jurisdiction here.\n\nStep 4: This leaves us considering whether another basis for federal jurisdiction exists. One possible candidate is the presence of a federal question. But even though Antril brings a federal-question claim against Acme, the Supreme Court has held that the mere existence of a federal question is insufficient to confer federal jurisdiction when the resolution of that question turns solely on questions of fact rather than law. See Gunn v. Minton, 133 S.Ct. 1059 (2013).\n\nStep 5: Thus, unless Antril can show that Acme transported polymolysorbate without proper secondary containment, thereby establishing liability under the FTTA, then the court will lack power to hear the federal-question claim against Acme.",

But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several�perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can�t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it.

            "final_answer": "that corresponds to the final answer after updating the reasoning.\n\n\n=====================================================================\n\n\nHere is the legal_context:\n\n\nMongrel jurisdiction: Supplemental claims. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several�perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can�t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn�t arise under federal law, and there�s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn�t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein�s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same ��nucleus of operative facts�� but could not be brought in federal court alone.  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,  383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such ��supplemental�� jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. �1367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same ��case or controversy.�� Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the ��common nucleus of operative facts�� test of  Gibbs.  So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to  Chapter 14 ) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn�t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here�s a basic illustration.9. Tagging along.  Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He sues in federal court. Isaacs claims that United fired him because of his age, replacing him with a younger employee. Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction\nover all of Isaacs' claims.\n\n\n\nLegal Context Analysis:\n\n\n\nThe legal context revolves around the concept of supplemental jurisdiction in civil procedure.

            "Context": "Challenges to subject matter jurisdiction Because the outer limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction are established in the Constitution, the federal courts are careful not to exceed those limits. Thus, they will almost always entertain objections to their jurisdiction, even if they were not raised at the outset of the case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (whenever it appears that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, court shall dismiss the action). Thus, for example, the parties cannot consent to the federal court hearing a case over which it lacks jurisdiction. Even if none of the parties asserts an objection to the court�s power to hear the case, the court will dismiss on its own motion if it appears that there is no jurisdiction over the case. Consider the following question.",
            "Question": "10. Second thoughts.  Taney, from Wisconsin, sues Ivanov, his Wisconsin landlord, for damages suffered when the house he rented from Ivanov collapsed. He alleges that Ivanov was negligent in failing to comply with federal structural standards applicable to buildings offered for rent to tenants subsidized under the Federal Housing Act. Ivanov answers the complaint denying liability, and the parties proceed to engage in discovery. Ten months later, Taney becomes disenchanted with the federal judge assigned to hear the case. Since he has some doubt as to whether his claim meets arising-under standards, he moves to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that the case does not arise under federal law. The motion should be",

B.  granted, if the court concludes that the case does not satisfy the standard for a case ��arising under�� federal law. C.  denied, because Taney, by filing suit in federal court, waived any objection to the court�s lack of jurisdiction. D.  denied, because Taney waived any objection to subject matter jurisdiction by litigating the case for ten months without raising the jurisdictional issue.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the authority given to a particular court to try certain cases. In this scenario, Taney's lawsuit against Ivanov involves allegations of negligence related to compliance with federal structural standards applicable to buildings offered for rent to tenants subsidized under the Federal Housing Act. This suggests that the case may involve a federal question, thereby potentially satisfying the requirements for subject-matter jurisdiction under Article III, §2.\n\nStep 2: However, the Supreme Court has clarified that the statutory grant of jurisdiction found in 28 U.S.C. §1331 requires more than just a federal question; rather, the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint must establish either that federal law creates the cause of action asserted or that the plaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends upon resolution of a substantial question of federal materiality. If the court determines that the case does not meet these criteria, then dismissal would likely follow due to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Furthermore, the timing of Taney's challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction is also pertinent. While generally speaking, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can be made at any time during litigation, including after extensive proceedings have taken place, such as here where the parties engaged in discovery for ten months before Taney moved to dismiss, the fact remains that the court retains discretion to address the issue sua sponte whenever it arises.\n\n\nStep 4: Given the above considerations, we now turn our attention to evaluating each possible course of action presented in the options below.\n\n\n\n---",

Generally, the parties cannot waive the requirement of subject-matter jurisdiction, but the court itself may raise the issue at any point during the proceeding.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to examine the specific circumstances surrounding Taney's decision to move to dismiss. Although he initially filed the suit in federal court, he waited until ten months had passed before expressing doubts about the court's jurisdiction. This delay might suggest that Taney could be deemed to have waived his objection to subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering the possibility that Taney's concerns regarding subject-matter jurisdiction arose belatedly, we must evaluate whether the court still possesses the authority to decide the issue despite the passage of time since the initial filing.\n\n---",

            "Context": "Arising under jurisdiction in the Supreme Court The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn�t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in  Mottley.  And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in  Mottley  bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn�t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn,  the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is ��an ingredient�� in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the  Mottley  rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. �1331, to which the  Mottley  rule applies,  does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court.  It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court�s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. �1257, is a great deal broader than �1331. 28 U.S.C. �1257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised�by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. �1331, as interpreted in  Mottley,  since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court�s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under �1257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is ��repugnant to the Constitution.�� Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.",

            "Context": "The basic standard for removal jurisdiction The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court�s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing  a case to federal court should mirror the standard for  filing  one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. �1441(a) provides that ��any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction�� may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, �2? If not, it can�t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here�s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.",

After answering, Pollux removes the action to federal court.",

The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: �1441(b)(2).  A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in  favor  of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration.",

Swensson answers the complaint, denying that he battered Ortiz, and asserts in the answer a counterclaim demanding damages under 42 U.S.C. �1983, for violation of his federal civil rights in the course of the arrest. Within the thirty-day period for removal, Swensson files a notice of removal in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Assume that Dracut agrees to the removal.",

Given these facts, we should consider whether either of these conditions affects our ability to exercise diversity jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: According to §1441(b)(2), when determining whether a case involving multiple defendants can be removed due to diversity jurisdiction, courts look specifically at whether any 'party in interest' who was properly joined and served as a defendant is a citizen of the same state where the action is pending.

            "Context": "Removal later in the litigation. The removal statute sets a strict limit on the time for removing a case to federal court. Under 28 U.S.C. �1446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days ��after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. . . .�� There�s a reason for this short window to remove a case. The state court needs to know whether it is going to hear the case or not. Under �1446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won�t be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but  becomes removable  later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can�t be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn�t removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in �1446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under �1446(b)(3), this ploy won�t work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court. Here�s an interesting question on the application of �1446(b)(3).",

Diversified is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Colorado. It has a large office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Diversified brings the action in Colorado. Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account. Four months later, Diversified moves to amend its complaint to add a claim against Eagleton under a federal fraud statute, based on misrepresentations Eagleton allegedly made in establishing her margin account. The motion is granted. Two weeks later, Eagleton removes the action to federal court. Diversified moves to remand the case to state court. The motion to remand should be",

C.  denied, because Eagleton had the right, under 28 U.S.C. �1446(b)(2), to remove within thirty days after the amendment was granted. D.  denied, because Eagleton had the right, under 28 U.S.C. �1446(b)(2), to remove within thirty days after receiving notice that the amendment had been granted.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand when a case may be removed to federal court. According to 28 U.S.C. §1446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. However, there's an exception - sometimes a case filed in state court isn't removable but becomes removable later.\n\nStep 2: We're given two examples where a case isn't removable initially but becomes removable later. One scenario involves McCoy suing Caswell on a state-law claim, and another scenario involves McCoy suing Gupta on a state-law claim and also suing Caswell as a co-defendant. Both scenarios aren't removable initially but become removable later.\n\nStep 3: To address these situations, Congress enacted section 1446(b)(3), allowing defendants to remove actions that weren't removable when they were first filed but became removable afterward. Specifically, this subsection states that if the action wasn't removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order making the action removable.\n\nStep 4: Applying this rule to our problem, we see that Diversified initially sued Eagleton solely on a state-law claim for breach of contract. Later, Diversified moved to amend its complaint to include a federal-fraud claim against Eagleton. After granting the motion, Eagleton promptly removed the action to federal court.\n\nStep 5: Given that the original lawsuit didn't contain a federal claim, Eagleton couldn't immediately remove it. Instead, she waited until Diversified added the new federal claim via amendment before exercising her right to remove the suit.",

A logical corollary of this conceptual thinking was that, if the state court did not have jurisdiction over a case, it could not be removed to federal court. Suppose, for example, that Wyzanski files suit against Koukios for patent infringement in a state court, and that Koukios removes it to federal court. Wyzanski�s case arises under federal law, so it is within the federal court�s jurisdiction. The twist here, however, is that Congress has provided in 28 U.S.C. �1338(a) that federal jurisdiction in patent cases is exclusive of the courts of the states. Thus, the state court in which the case was filed had no jurisdiction to entertain Wyzanski�s claim in the first place. Under the ��derivative jurisdiction�� reasoning of an earlier day, Koukios could not remove Wyzanski�s suit to federal court. The federal court�s jurisdiction was thought to ��derive from�� that of the state court. If the state court lacked jurisdiction, the federal court could not acquire jurisdiction on removal. You couldn�t, under this theory, make something out of nothing. So the court had to dismiss the claim. It couldn�t even remand it to state court, since that court had no jurisdiction. The result was that, because the case had to be in federal court, the federal court would dismiss it! There was a certain formal logic to this rule, but not a lot of common sense. After the federal court dismissed the action, the plaintiff would have to refile . . . in the federal court. So Congress wisely enacted 28 U.S.C. �1441(f): ��The court to which such civil action is removed under this section is not precluded from hearing and determining any claim in such civil action because the State court from which such civil action is removed did not have jurisdiction over that claim.�� Under �1441(f), the federal court acquires jurisdiction over a removed case, even if the state court from which it was removed had none. This question requires application of �1441(f) and the basics of supplemental jurisdiction. If you haven�t studied supplemental jurisdiction, you may want to come back to it.",

D.  take jurisdiction over the entire case.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: Since Toricelli's copyright claim falls exclusively within the federal court's jurisdiction as per 28 U.S.C. §1338(a), we need to consider how this affects the overall jurisdiction of the federal court when the case is removed from state court.\n\nStep 2: According to 28 U.S.C. §1441(f), the federal court does not lose jurisdiction over a removed case simply because the original state court lacked jurisdiction over part of the claim. Therefore, despite the lack of jurisdiction over the copyright claim at the state level, the federal court still gains jurisdiction through removal.\n\nStep 3: However, there might be concerns about diversity jurisdiction regarding the remaining claim - the breach of contract between two citizens of the same state.

            "Context": "The effect of removal on objections to personal jurisdiction. Students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction. Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn�t sure that her objection will carry the day; it�s a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she�s going to remove, she�s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and  then remove to federal court  within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal  does not waive  the defendant�s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the  federal  court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction.

Section 1447(c) provides in part: ��A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).�� This section requires that, if any party has an objection to removal, other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, she must raise it within thirty days after removal, or the objection is waived. For example, if the plaintiff claimed the case wasn�t removed within thirty days, she could seek remand on this ground, but only within thirty days after removal. The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the  first  thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of �1447(c)�s waiver provision.",

This objection does not come too late, since objections to subject matter are not covered by the thirty-day limit on most objections to removal. B.  granted, because Ivens did not join in the notice of removal and removal requires agreement of all the defendants. C.  denied, because the court has original jurisdiction over the case and Ivens�s objection has been waived. D.  denied, because removal was proper, since the case is within the federal diversity jurisdiction.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we analyze whether the defendant's objection comes too late. Since the objection is not about lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, it falls outside the scope of §1447(c), which allows parties to object to removal within thirty days after the notice of removal is filed. Therefore, Ivens' objection may still be considered timely.\n\nStep 2: Next, we examine whether the removal itself was valid. To remove a case to federal court, all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal. Here, however, Ivens did not join in the notice of removal; instead, he waited until two months later to move to remand. Thus, the removal was improper due to Ivens' non-consent.\n\nStep 3: Given that the removal was invalid, we consider what happens next. When a case is improperly removed, the district court typically grants the motion to remand. In this scenario, since Ivens objected to the removal and the removal was indeed defective, the court should grant his motion.",

            "Context": "In-state contacts as an alternative basis for exercising jurisdiction. To some extent, the logic of  Pennoyer  persists. In  Burnham v. Superior Court,  495 U.S. 604 (1990), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that an individual defendant who is served with process in the state will usually be subject to personal jurisdiction in the action for which service was made. But the  Pennoyer  framework for jurisdiction never worked very well for corporations. Ultimately, the Supreme Court, in  International Shoe v. Washington,  326 U.S. 310 (1945), held that another basis, ��minimum contacts . . . such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend �traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice� �� (326 U.S. at 316), would also support personal jurisdiction over a defendant. Subsequent cases have made clear that such ��minimum contacts�� jurisdiction applies to individual defendants as well as corporations. The rationale underlying minimum contacts jurisdiction is different from that underlying  Pennoyer. International Shoe  recognized that the ��due process�� required by the Constitution could be based not only on the formalistic concept of physical arrest, but also on the idea that a defendant, by choosing to engage in activities in a state, submitted to litigation there if claims arose out of those voluntary activities in the state. The idea is that it is fair to make the defendant take the bitter with the sweet. If she chooses to engage in activities focused on a state, that state may require her to answer there for claims that arise from those activities she chooses to conduct in the state. She may not be sued there for  any  claim based on limited in-state activities, however, only for claims arising out of the in-state activities.

Since both parties involved are individuals, this falls under individual law.\n\n\nStep 2: Next, let's recall how personal jurisdiction works according to the US Supreme Court's decision in  Pennoyer v. Neff, where they established that personal jurisdiction requires either consent, waiver, or presence within the forum state when serving someone with process.\n\n\nStep 3: However, the scenario presented involves a situation after  Pennoyer, specifically involving  International Shoe Co. v. Washington, which introduced the concept of'minimum contacts' as a new standard for determining personal jurisdiction beyond mere physical presence or consent.\n\n\nStep 4: According to  International Shoe, personal jurisdiction can be exercised over a non-resident defendant if their actions create sufficient connections ('minimum contacts') between themselves and the forum state, making it reasonable to expect them to defend lawsuits arising from these interactions.\n\n\nStep 5: Now, considering the specifics of our case, Neff visited Oregon, consulted with attorney Mitchell regarding a dispute, and received services from Mitchell before leaving without paying the invoice. This interaction creates a connection between Neff and Oregon because Neff initiated contact seeking advice and engaged in business dealings within the state.\n\n\nStep 6: Therefore, applying the principle of  International Shoe, Neff's deliberate engagement in professional services within Oregon constitutes sufficient'minimum contacts,' allowing the Oregon courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over him for disputes directly linked to those activities.\n\n\nStep 7: It's essential to note that the jurisdiction isn't universal; rather, it's specific to the claim being litigated.

Instead, it focuses on whether the defendant's actions establish significant ties to the forum state, particularly concerning the issue at hand.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Applying the principles outlined in International Shoe to our scenario, we observe that Neff deliberately sought professional advice from Mitchell while physically present in Oregon.

But, where the defendant�s contacts with the state are limited,  Shoe  established an important limitation on such jurisdiction: The plaintiff may only assert claims against the defendant that arise from those voluntary contacts. The idea is that the defendant, by establishing limited in-state contacts, submits to jurisdiction there for claims that arise from those contacts, but not for other, unrelated claims. Recall that, under  Pennoyer, the ��contact�� of being served with process in the state subjected the defendant to suit for whatever claim the plaintiff had filed. But ��minimum contacts�� jurisdiction is limited: It is only as broad as the defendant�s in-state voluntary contacts themselves. A corollary of this is that a defendant can have contacts in a state, but not be subject to suit there on a particular claim. The following example illustrates this fundamental point.

            "updated_reasoning": "---\nInternational Shoe v. Washington set forth the principle of �minimum contacts.� Under this rule, a non-resident defendant is subject to general personal jurisdiction in any forum where the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts. These contacts include having continuous and systematic general business contacts in the forum state. Alternatively, a nonresident defendant may be subject to general personal jurisdiction in a single state if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts in that state. For purposes of specific personal jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has ruled that a non-resident defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in a state if the defendant has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of that state’s laws. Purposeful availment requires that the defendant engage in intentional acts aimed at the forum state, rather than merely engaging in random, isolated, or fortuitous events. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has stated that the quality and nature of the defendant’s contact with the forum state must be evaluated to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice. Finally, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause limits the power of federal courts to assert personal jurisdiction over individuals. Therefore, the standard used to determine whether a non-resident defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in a federal diversity action is essentially identical to the standard applied in state-court proceedings. Thus, the same rules apply to both federal and state courts. When applying the test for personal jurisdiction, courts typically use a three-part inquiry to determine whether a non-resident defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in a particular state. First, the court determines whether the defendant has been properly served with process. Second, the court evaluates whether the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state. Third, the court considers whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Courts often refer to this third prong as the �fairness� inquiry. The fairness inquiry involves balancing several factors, including the burden placed on the defendant, the interest of the forum state in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiffs’ interest in obtaining relief in the chosen forum, the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the states in promoting substantive social policy. Ultimately, the goal of the fairness inquiry is to ensure that the assertion of personal jurisdiction serves the ends of justice and does not unfairly burden the defendant. Personal Jurisdiction - Specific vs General\nSpecific personal jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court to hear a case involving a party who resides outside the state where the court sits. Specific personal jurisdiction arises when a non-resident defendant engages in activity related to the controversy in the forum state. Examples of situations giving rise to specific personal jurisdiction include a car manufacturer selling cars in a state and then facing a product liability lawsuit in that state; a company soliciting business in a state via mail order catalogs and then facing a contract dispute in that state; and a newspaper publishing defamatory statements about someone residing in a different state and then facing a defamation lawsuit in that state. On the other hand, general personal jurisdiction allows a court to hear any type of case involving a resident of the state, regardless of whether the case relates to the controversy in the state. An example of general personal jurisdiction might involve a corporation incorporated in a state and sued in that state for breach of contract entered into elsewhere. Another example might involve a bank located in a state and sued in that state for money damages resulting from a loan transaction occurring in another state. Generally speaking, a court exercises general personal jurisdiction over a defendant whenever the defendant is domiciled in the state or maintains a regular place of business there. By contrast, a court exercises specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant whenever the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privileges and immunities of a foreign jurisdiction and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arose out of or relate to activities conducted within that jurisdiction. The distinction between general and specific personal jurisdiction turns largely on the scope of the defendant’s contacts with the forum state. Where the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are extensive and ongoing, a court generally asserts general personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Conversely, where the defendant’s contacts with the forum state are limited and sporadic, a court usually asserts specific personal jurisdiction over the defendant. As noted above, the key difference between general and specific personal jurisdiction lies in the breadth of the defendant’s contacts with the forum state. Specifically, general personal jurisdiction applies when the defendant has systemic and pervasive contacts with the forum state, while specific personal jurisdiction applies when the defendant has occasional and isolated contacts with the forum state. Because the reach of general personal jurisdiction extends beyond the confines of the controversy, it raises concerns about unfairness and abuse of process. Consequently, the U.S. Supreme Court has articulated strict requirements for the exercise of general personal jurisdiction. In particular, the Court has held that general personal jurisdiction exists only when a defendant is “at home” in the forum state – i.e., when the defendant is either incorporated or has its principal place of business in the forum state. Outside of these circumstances, a court may only exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant. The distinction between general and specific personal jurisdiction matters significantly in practice because it affects the ability of parties to bring suits against defendants who reside outside the state where the court sits. When a plaintiff seeks to sue a defendant who resides outside the state where the court sits, the plaintiff must choose between seeking general or specific personal jurisdiction. If the plaintiff chooses to seek general personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff faces high hurdles in demonstrating that the defendant is “at home” in the forum state. Moreover, even if the plaintiff succeeds in showing that the defendant is “at home,” the defendant may still challenge the exercise of general personal jurisdiction on constitutional grounds. By contrast, if the plaintiff seeks specific personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has purposefully availed herself of the privileges and immunities of the forum state and that the litigation results from alleged injuries that arose out of or relate to activities conducted within that jurisdiction. Although the plaintiff bears the burden of proof in establishing specific personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff enjoys greater flexibility in choosing among various jurisdictions in which to file suit. Overall, understanding the differences between general and specific personal jurisdiction is crucial for navigating complex disputes involving parties who reside outside the state where the court sits.

            "Context": "The difference between foreseeability and purposeful availment. The basic premise of minimum contacts jurisdiction is that the defendant who chooses to relate to a state�who ��purposely avails�� herself of the opportunity to conduct activities there�can expect to be sued there for claims that arise from that relationship. A suit there shouldn�t come as a surprise to her since she chose to relate to the state and can foresee this consequence of her conduct there. So foreseeability certainly has some role to play in determining whether minimum contacts jurisdiction exists. But there is a difference between foreseeing the possibility of injury in a state and the type of ��purposeful availment�� that supports minimum contacts jurisdiction. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286 (1980), the Supreme Court distinguished between foreseeability that a product would go to a state and foreseeability that the defendant could be sued there based on deliberate contacts. In  World-Wide,  the dealership, Seaway, sold an automobile to the plaintiffs. Certainly, nothing is more foreseeable than that a car will travel; that�s what it�s for. But the Court held that this did not support jurisdiction over the New York seller in Oklahoma, where the plaintiffs drove it and had an accident. Instead, said the Court, the foreseeability that is relevant to personal jurisdiction is the foreseeability that ��the defendant�s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.�� 444 U.S. at 297. Jurisdiction, then, must be based, not on the fact that a defendant could foresee that events might happen there that would lead to a claim against her, but rather on purposeful availment. When the defendant makes the conscious, voluntary, avoidable decision to interact with people in a state, she assumes the risk that suits that arise from that purposeful interaction will be filed in the state where she chose to act. Here are two examples that illustrate this distinction.",

It sells a replacement tank to Deuce Petroleum Company in Kansas, which has it mounted on the bed of its delivery truck and places it in service. As Ace was aware, Deuce delivers petroleum products to customers throughout the Midwest. While making a delivery in Illinois, the tank explodes, injuring Jack. Jack sues Ace Truck Bodies in Illinois for his injuries. Ace Truck has no contacts with Illinois other than those described in this question. The Illinois long-arm statute authorizes the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant who ��commits a tortious act in Illinois.�� The Illinois Supreme Court has held, in  Gray v.

C.  subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois, because it committed a tortious act in Illinois under the long-arm statute. D.  not subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois, because its contacts with Illinois are insufficient to support jurisdiction over it under the minimum contacts test.",

This involves examining whether Ace's interactions with Illinois were sufficient to establish purposeful availment, thereby allowing them to reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\n\nStep 2: We know that Ace built gasoline tanks in Minnesota for use across various states, including potentially Illinois, through their sales to companies like Deuce Petroleum Company in Kansas. However, the key factor here is whether these actions constitute purposeful availment, meaning they made a conscious effort to engage with Illinois residents or businesses.\n\nStep 3: Purposeful availment requires more than just foreseeability that a product may reach a particular state due to normal channels of commerce. Rather, it necessitates intentional action aimed directly at interacting with individuals or entities within another state.\n\nStep 4: Given that Ace knew their tanks would likely be transported to multiple locations beyond Kansas, including possibly Illinois, does not necessarily mean they engaged in purposeful availment regarding Illinois specifically.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, without evidence suggesting Ace deliberately targeted or significantly benefited from doing business in Illinois, mere awareness that their product might enter the state doesn't suffice to demonstrate purposeful availment.",

            "Context": "The role of reasonableness in minimum contacts analysis There is a good deal of discussion in the Supreme Court�s personal jurisdiction cases about the reasonableness of asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant. In  McGee v. International Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220 (1957), for example, the Court noted that the increased ease of transportation and communication has reduced the inconvenience of defending an action in another state. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980), the Court stated that the burden of defending in a foreign state will be considered in light of other factors, including the plaintiff�s interest in obtaining a remedy, the forum state�s interest in adjudicating the dispute, and shared interests of the states in furthering substantive policies. And, in  Asahi Metal Industry v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102 (1987), the Court rejected jurisdiction over the impleaded Japanese defendant on reasonableness grounds, concluding that, even if it had minimum contacts with California (a point disputed among the Justices), it would be unreasonable to assert jurisdiction over Asahi on the facts of the case. Thus,  Asahi  stands for the proposition that in some cases, even if the defendant has established deliberate contacts in the state that gave rise to the plaintiff�s claim, it will be unreasonable for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. In assessing reasonableness, a court should consider the plaintiff�s interest in obtaining a convenient remedy, the forum state�s interest in providing it, the extent of the inconvenience to the defendant, and other factors. But the opposite is also true: Sometimes, even if the interests of the state and the plaintiff would support taking jurisdiction, and even if it would not significantly inconvenience the defendant to do so, it may still be impermissible. Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. 444 U.S. at 294. If the defendant has  not  established contacts in the state, these other interests cannot substitute for contacts. First, the defendant must establish deliberate contacts focused on the forum state. If she has, the interests of the plaintiff and the forum state become relevant on the second prong of the test, whether it would be fair and reasonable to exercise jurisdiction. If she has not, these factors cannot in themselves support jurisdiction. Consider the following case.",

Lonergan is a Minnesota auto salesman. They talk. Fein tells Lonergan that she is from Wisconsin. She agrees to buy an expensive Maserati from Lonergan, who deals in used cars out of his home in Minnesota, about 20 miles from the Wisconsin border. After returning home, Fein sends him a deposit check. Lonergan cashes the check, but does not buy the car, and never contacts Fein again. Fein sues him for fraud in Wisconsin. She chooses to sue at home in part because Wisconsin has a tough fraud statute, authorizing treble damages for fraud in auto sales transactions. The Wisconsin court",

B.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan, because Wisconsin has a strong interest (reflected in the statute) in protecting Wisconsin citizens from fraud. C.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan because Fein has a strong interest in obtaining a remedy, Lonergan knew that Fein was from Wisconsin, and he will not be inconvenienced by litigation in Wisconsin, since he lives close to the border. D.  will probably not have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the Wisconsin court has personal jurisdiction over Lonergan, we need to assess whether there were sufficient minimum contacts between Lonergan and Wisconsin. Since Lonergan did not engage in business activities within Wisconsin, such as selling cars through advertisements directed towards Wisconsinites, nor did he own property or conduct significant operations in the state, we conclude that he lacks purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of Wisconsin's laws.\n\nStep 2: Purposeful availment requires more than mere physical presence in the state. It demands intentional direction or avowal of benefit toward this sovereign. Here, Lonergan sold a car to someone he met outside of Wisconsin, without targeting or soliciting customers in the Badger State. Therefore, we find that Lonergan lacked the necessary intent to subject himself to Wisconsin's authority.\n\nStep 3: Given that Lonergan failed to demonstrate purposeful availment, we turn our attention to the next question - whether exercising jurisdiction over him would comport with traditional notions of fairness and substantial justice. While Wisconsin might have a legitimate interest in regulating fraudulent activity affecting its residents, and Fein certainly has a compelling interest in seeking redress for what appears to be a wrong committed against her, we note that Lonergan resides near the Wisconsin-Minnesota border and thus faces relatively little inconvenience in litigating in either state.",

            "updated_reasoning": "====================================================================\nHere's the problem:\n\n\nThe role of reasonableness in minimum contacts analysis There is a good deal of discussion in the Supreme Court’s personal jurisdiction cases about the reasonableness of asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant. In  McGee v. International Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220 (1957), for example, the Court noted that the increased ease of transportation and communication has reduced the inconvenience of defending an action in another state. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980), the Court stated that the burden of defending in a foreign state will be considered in light of other factors, including the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining a remedy, the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, and shared interests of the states in furthering substantive policies. And, in  Asahi Metal Industry v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102 (1987), the Court rejected jurisdiction over the impleaded Japanese defendant on reasonableness grounds, concluding that, even if it had minimum contacts with California (a point disputed among the Justices), it would be unreasonable to assert jurisdiction over Asahi on the facts of the case. Thus,  Asahi  stands for the proposition that in some cases, even if the defendant has established deliberate contacts in the state that gave rise to the plaintiff’s claim, it will be unreasonable for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. In assessing reasonableness, a court should consider the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining a convenient remedy, the forum state’s interest in providing it, the extent of the inconvenience to the defendant, and other factors. But the opposite is also true: Sometimes, even if the interests of the state and the plaintiff would support taking jurisdiction, and even if it would not significantly inconvenience the defendant to do so, it may still be impermissible. Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. 444 U.S. at 294. If the defendant has  not  established contacts in the state, these other interests cannot substitute for contacts. First, the defendant must establish deliberate contacts focused on the forum state. If she has, the interests of the plaintiff and the forum state become relevant on the second prong of the test, whether it would be fair and reasonable to exercise jurisdiction. If she has not, these factors cannot in themselves support jurisdiction. Consider the following case.6. A matter of convenience.  Fein, from Wisconsin, meets Lonergan, a college classmate of her sister, while Fein is visiting her sister in Minnesota. Lonergan is a Minnesota auto salesman. They talk. Fein tells Lonergan that she is from Wisconsin. She agrees to buy an expensive Maserati from Lonergan, who deals in used cars out of his home in Minnesota, about 20 miles from the Wisconsin border. After returning home, Fein sends him a deposit check. Lonergan cashes the check, but does not buy the car, and never contacts Fein again. Fein sues him for fraud in Wisconsin. She chooses to sue at home in part because Wisconsin has a tough fraud statute, authorizing treble damages for fraud in auto sales transactions. The Wisconsin courtOptions: A.  will have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan if, as a matter of choice of law, it would apply the Wisconsin fraud statute to the transaction. B.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan, because Wisconsin has a strong interest (reflected in the statute) in protecting Wisconsin citizens from fraud. C.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan because Fein has a strong interest in obtaining a remedy, Lonergan knew that Fein was from Wisconsin, and he will not be inconvenienced by litigation in Wisconsin, since he lives close to the border. D.  will probably not have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan.Step 1: To determine whether the Wisconsin court has personal jurisdiction over Lonergan, we need to assess whether there were sufficient minimum contacts between Lonergan and Wisconsin. Since Lonergan did not engage in business activities within Wisconsin, such as selling cars through advertisements directed towards Wisconsinites, nor did he own property or conduct significant operations in the state, we conclude that he lacks purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of Wisconsin's laws.\n\nStep 2: Purposeful availment requires more than mere physical presence in the state. It demands intentional direction or avowal of benefit toward this sovereign. Here, Lonergan sold a car to someone he met outside of Wisconsin, without targeting or soliciting customers in the Badger State. Therefore, we find that Lonergan lacked the necessary intent to subject himself to Wisconsin's authority.\n\nStep 3: Given that Lonergan failed to demonstrate purposeful availment, we turn our attention to the next question - whether exercising jurisdiction over him would comport with traditional notions of fairness and substantial justice. While Wisconsin might have a legitimate interest in regulating fraudulent activity affecting its residents, and Fein certainly has a compelling interest in seeking redress for what appears to be a wrong committed against her, we note that Lonergan resides near the Wisconsin-Minnesota border and thus faces relatively little inconvenience in litigating in either state.--1 In Step 1: How could the fact that Lonergan dealt in used cars out of his home potentially impact the assessment of purposeful availment?\n--2 In Step 1: Does the fact that Lonergan lived near the Wisconsin-Minnesota border necessarily mean that he would face “relatively little” inconvenience in litigating in either state?\n--3 In Step 2: What specific criteria would be required to establish that Lonergan intentionally directed his actions toward the state of Wisconsin?\n--4 In Step 2: Would the fact that Lonergan knowingly sold a car to someone from Wisconsin suffice to meet the requirement of purposeful availment?\n--5 In Step 3: Are there any additional considerations beyond those mentioned that might influence the determination of whether exercising jurisdiction over Lonergan would be fair and just?\n--6 In Step 3: Could the fact that Fein chose to sue in Wisconsin due to the state’s favorable tort law create a conflict of interest or undermine the notion of fairness in the jurisdiction decision?\n--7 In Step 3: Is it accurate to assume that Lonergan would face similar levels of inconvenience in both Wisconsin and Minnesota when considering potential jurisdictions?\n--8 In Step 3: Should the court take into account the possibility that Lonergan may have been aware of the Wisconsin fraud statute prior to engaging in the sale, thereby influencing his decision-making process regarding where to sell the vehicle?\n--9 In Step 3: Can the court reasonably expect that Litigation costs associated with traveling to Wisconsin versus Minnesota would be equivalent for Lonergan?\n--10 In Step 3: Might the fact that Fein sent a deposit",

            "Context": "The erratic stream of commerce No one ever said that minimum contacts is simple. In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying  Shoe �s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed�or obfuscated�in  Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in  J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro , 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. ��Stream of commerce�� is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant�s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake�s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser�s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it ( not  where she took it, as  World-Wide  holds). See  World-Wide,  444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor�s efforts to ��serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states��). But the Court later divided on this issue in  Asahi . In  Asahi,  the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O�Connor�s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O�Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part�or 100,000 parts�from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer�s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such ��purposeful availment�� if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts,  itself,  to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan�s concurring opinion in  Asahi,  however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant�s product in an American state,  even  indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes ��purposeful availment�� in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that,  even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously�for twenty- four years�for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in  J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro , 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In  Nicastro  the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy�s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not ��engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey�� (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro�s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, ��no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.�� And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither  Asahi  nor  McIntyre  provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.",
            "Question": "7. One end of the spectrum.  Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells five hundred drill presses to Emporia in 2011. Emporia resells three of them to Modern Tool and Die Company in Maryland. A local machine shop buys one from Modern, and Edwards, an employee, is injured using it in Maryland. He sues Atlanta Precision in state court in Maryland for his injuries. Atlanta Precision has no other contacts in Maryland. After the  Nicastro  decision the Maryland court will probably conclude that it",
            "Options": "Options: A.  has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it is an American company, unlike Asahi and J. McIntyre. B.  has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it could foresee that Emporia, which is based in Pennsylvania, would resell Atlanta Precision�s machines into nearby Maryland. C.  has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it sold its machines in large quantities to a distributor which it expected to resell in other states. D.  cannot exercise jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because its contacts with Maryland are insufficient under the minimum contacts test.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the Maryland court has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, let's analyze each option individually.\n\n\nStep 2: Option A suggests that having an American company is enough to establish jurisdiction. However, being an American company alone does not necessarily mean that the company has sufficient minimum contacts with the state where the lawsuit is pending.\n\n\nStep 3: Option B implies that Atlanta Precision should have foreseen that Emporia, a distributor located in Pennsylvania, would resell their machines into neighboring Maryland. While reasonable minds may differ about how far ahead companies need to look, courts generally consider more than just the actions of intermediaries in determining minimum contacts.\n\n\nStep 4: Option C posits that selling large quantities of machines to a distributor who expects to resell them in multiple states supports jurisdiction. Given the significant number of machines sold to Emporia and the likelihood that they would be distributed throughout various regions, including Maryland, this argument seems plausible.\n\n\nStep 5: Option D asserts that Atlanta Precision lacks sufficient contacts with Maryland due to the lack of direct involvement in the state. Although true, this statement doesn't address the specific circumstances presented here, particularly regarding the substantial volume of machines sold to Emporia and subsequently redistributed across regional markets.\n\n\nStep 6: Considering the above points, the most compelling rationale supporting jurisdiction lies within Option C - the sheer scale of sales coupled with expectations surrounding redistribution patterns strongly indicates that Atlanta Precision engaged in activities reasonably calculated to invoke the benefits and protections of Maryland law.",

            "Context": "The meaning of general in personam jurisdiction. The previous chapter iterates, and reiterates, that jurisdiction based on a defendant�s ��minimum contacts�� with the forum is limited to claims that arise out of those contacts. If a defendant conducts limited activities directed to the forum state, it is subject to ��specific�� personal jurisdiction for claims arising out of those contacts, but not for other claims that arise in other states. However, in  International Shoe  the Court suggested that a defendant�s contacts in the state may sometimes be so extensive that it could be sued there for any claim against it, no matter where it arose. ��[T]here have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.�� 326 U.S at 318. The premise behind general in personam jurisdiction is that, where a defendant�s contacts are sufficiently extensive in the forum state, it is neither unfair nor inconvenient to require it to defend any lawsuit there, including ones that arise in other states. Thus, if International Shoe is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Missouri, it could be sued there for unemployment taxes due in Washington, or breach of a contract in Colorado. This is analogous to general in personam jurisdiction over an individual defendant based on her domicile in the state. In  Milliken v. Meyer,  311 U.S. 457 (1940), the Supreme Court affirmed that a person�s domicile is such an important connection to a state, and confers sufficient benefits, that an individual domiciled in a state may fairly be required to defend any claim in that state. Let�s start by distinguishing assertions of general in personam jurisdiction from other exercises of jurisdiction. Consider the following question.",

Truscott sues Mancini Motors, a Texas corporation that sells antique cars at its dealerships in Texas and California. Truscott sues in New Mexico, for injuries he suffered in New Mexico while driving a 1964 Ford Mustang that Mancini had advertised in New Mexico, sold to Truscott, and shipped to him in New Mexico. Truscott serves Mancini with process in the action at the Texas dealership. Mancini has no place of business in New Mexico, but sells three or four cars a year there. C.  Truscott sues Mancini Motors, the Texas antique car company, in Texas. He seeks damages for misrepresentations a Mancini salesperson made to him at a Mancini dealership in California, which led him to purchase a car at the California dealership. D.  Cartwright sues Skilful Electric Tool Company in Michigan for injuries he suffered there using a Skilful saw he bought in Michigan. Skilful is incorporated in Delaware, manufactures its saws in Tennessee, where its home offices are, and sells its saws to wholesalers around the United States.

            "Context": "What contacts suffice for general in personam jurisdiction? For many years it was exquisitely unclear what contacts of a defendant would suffice to support general in personam jurisdiction�again, that means jurisdiction for claims that  did not  arise out of the defendant�s contacts with the state in which the suit is brought. In  Perkins v. Benguet Mining Co. , 342 U.S. 437 (1952), the Supreme Court considered whether a corporation that had fled the Philippines during the Second World War and was conducting skeletal operations from its temporary Ohio headquarters, could be sued in Ohio for a claim that arose elsewhere. In Perkins , there was really no place other than Ohio where the plaintiff could bring the action. The Court upheld jurisdiction in the Ohio court under these unusual circumstances, but did not elucidate what other contacts would suffice to allow jurisdiction over a claim that did not arise in the forum. In  Helicopteros Nationales de Columbia S.A. v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408 (1984), the defendant bought helicopters from Texas, and had entered Texas for related training and to negotiate a contract to provide transport services using the helicopters. But it provided those services in South America, and the crash that gave rise to the plaintiffs� claims took place there. The Court held that the defendant�s Texas contacts were insufficient to support general in personam jurisdiction. Since 2011, the Supreme Court has twice considered the reach of general in personam jurisdiction, in  Goodyear Dunlop Tire Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 U.S. 915 (2011), and in  Daimler A.G. v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117 (2014). In both cases, the Court endorsed the ��at home�� test as virtually the exclusive standard for assertions of general in personam jurisdiction, and held that a corporation is ��at home�� in its state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business. These cases substantially clarified�and narrowed�the scope of general in personam jurisdiction. Before them, many courts had exercised general in personam jurisdiction based on various extensive contacts in a state, such as extensive in-state facilities, employees, or sales. The Court in  Daimler did not quite foreclose the possibility that some extensive in-state contacts (other than incorporation and principal place of business) might support general in personam jurisdiction but suggested that in most cases such jurisdiction would be ��unacceptably grasping.�� 571 U.S. at 138.

Marathon Crane Company, an Iowa company with its home office and factory in Iowa, sold cranes to Partlett Construction Company, a South Dakota corporation. Marathon delivered the cranes to Partlett in South Dakota, but knew that Partlett did road construction throughout the Midwestern states. Over the past five years, Marathon has sold more than half of its cranes into Minnesota. Partlett took a Marathon crane from its yard in South Dakota to a job in Minnesota, where it collapsed, injuring Perez. Perez brought suit in Minnesota against Marathon for his injuries. In the same action, he asserted a claim against Francis, a Partlett supervisor who had negligently advised the crane operator� in South Dakota�that the crane would lift 10,000 pounds, though it was actually rated for 3,000. Francis is a Minnesota citizen who works in Partlett�s equipment yard in South Dakota. The Minnesota court",
            "Options": "Options: A.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon based on general jurisdiction. B.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon based on specific jurisdiction, since Marathon knew that Partlett used Marathon cranes in all Midwestern states. C.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon because, unlike in  Asahi , it would not be unreasonable to require Marathon to come from nearby South Dakota to Minnesota. D.  lacks personal jurisdiction over either defendant. E.  has general in personam jurisdiction over Francis, but does not have in personam jurisdiction over Marathon.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First we need to determine if the court has personal jurisdiction over each defendant separately. To begin, let's consider Marathon, the Iowa corporation. We know that Marathon sells cranes primarily outside of Iowa, including in Minnesota, and delivers them directly to customers like Partlett in South Dakota. However, none of this activity occurred within Minnesota itself; instead, the injury happened when a crane purchased by Partlett in South Dakota was taken to work in Minnesota.\n\nStep 2: Given that the injury giving rise to the lawsuit occurred outside of Minnesota, we're looking at whether the court may exercise general in personam jurisdiction over Marathon. General in personam jurisdiction allows a court to hear claims unrelated to the defendant's activities within the state. According to recent case law, particularly after  Daimler A.G. v. Bauman, a corporation is generally subject to general in personam jurisdiction in two places: its state of incorporation and the state where it maintains its principal place of business. \n\nStep 3: Here, Marathon is incorporated in Iowa and presumably conducts significant business there given its status as the home base for manufacturing and selling cranes across multiple states. This suggests that Marathon meets the criteria for being 'at home' in Iowa, making Iowa the primary location for exercising general in personam jurisdiction over Marathon.\n\nStep 4: Next, considering Francis, the Partlett supervisor who lives in Minnesota and works in South Dakota, we examine whether the court has personal jurisdiction over him. Specific jurisdiction requires a connection between the defendant's actions and the cause of action in the forum state. While Francis worked in South Dakota, advising the crane operation regarding lifting capacity, the incident causing harm occurred in Minnesota. Thus, the issue here revolves around whether Francis's conduct in another state gives rise to sufficient connections with Minnesota to justify asserting personal jurisdiction over him.\n\nStep 5: Considering the facts about Francis working in South Dakota yet having ties to Minnesota through residence, we look towards determining whether his presence in Minnesota provides enough nexus to assert personal jurisdiction specifically over him. It seems plausible that his role in advising the crane operation in South Dakota, coupled with his residency in Minnesota, creates a basis for personal jurisdiction over Francis in relation to the accident occurring in Minnesota.",

            "Context": "General in personam jurisdiction and principal place of business As  Chapter 2  explains, for purposes of  diversity jurisdiction , a corporation is deemed a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1). And now,  Goodyear  and  Daimler  approve general in personam jurisdiction in a corporation�s state of incorporation and principal place of business. This means the concept of ��principal place of business�� is relevant to both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction. So, we need to consider just what that phrase means, and whether it means the same thing in both contexts. In  Hertz Corp. v. Friend , 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the Supreme Court held that a corporation�s principal place of business  for diversity purposes  is, in all cases, the state of its headquarters. After  Hertz , a corporation is a citizen, under 28 U.S.C. �1332(c)(1), of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties. And in  Goodyear  and  Daimler , the Court suggested that general in personam jurisdiction will be proper in a corporation�s state of incorporation and its principal place of business. However, we don�t know that the Court will use the  Hertz  test as the test for ��principal place of business�� for purposes of general in personam jurisdiction! Perhaps it will look, in this different context, to the state where the most productive activity takes place rather than the corporate headquarters. It seems somewhat unlikely that it would simply borrow the  Hertz  standard, since the policies underlying diversity and personal jurisdiction analysis are different. So it is important to analyze diversity jurisdiction and general in personam jurisdiction separately, recognizing that the ��principal place of business�� concept may mean different things in these two contexts. To emphasize the point, consider the following, slightly wacky question.",

Its sales are spread around the Midwest: 55 percent of its sales are in Ohio, 18 percent are in Indiana, 11 percent are in Illinois, and the rest are scattered among six other states, including South Dakota.

It may also have personal jurisdiction over Quality for this claim, but we don�t know for sure.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's determine why there might not be subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit against Quality Auto Parts. Subject-matter jurisdiction requires either diversity jurisdiction or supplemental jurisdiction. Diversity jurisdiction exists when the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states and the amount-in-controversy exceeds $75,000. Here, however, Quality Auto Parts is a citizen of Delaware and Ohio; thus, neither party is diverse from the other because they share citizenship in multiple states. Therefore, there cannot be diversity jurisdiction over the suit.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's examine whether there could be supplemental jurisdiction over the suit against Quality Auto Parts. Supplemental jurisdiction allows a district court to hear claims brought by plaintiffs who lack standing to bring their own independent action, such as pendent state law claims. But here, the issue isn't really about supplemental jurisdiction - it's more about determining whether the court has personal jurisdiction over Quality Auto Parts.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering the facts given, we're trying to figure out whether the Ohio court has personal jurisdiction over Quality Auto Parts. Personal jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to order someone to appear before them. For a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant like Quality Auto Parts, the defendant generally needs to have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state (in this case, Ohio) so that exercising jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n\nStep 4: Given that Quality Auto Parts' sales are spread across several Midwestern states, including Ohio, and that it manufactures millions of dollars' worth of auto parts annually at its Ohio facility, it appears that Quality Auto Parts indeed has significant connections to Ohio. These factors suggest that Quality Auto Parts likely has sufficient minimum contacts with Ohio to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.",

            "Context": "The historical role of in rem jurisdiction Unlike jurisdiction ��in personam,�� that is, over the person of the defendant, ��in rem�� jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over a thing, an item of property. As  Pennoyer v. Neff  explains, for many years courts proceeded on the premise that their authority to exercise jurisdiction was based on physical power. A court could exercise jurisdiction over a person within the territory of the state (��in personam jurisdiction��) if he was symbolically arrested there through service of process. Or the court could exercise jurisdiction over property within the state (��in rem jurisdiction��) if the property was seized through attachment. The process for seizure of property through attachment varied from state to state, and for different types of property. Usually, land was (and still is) attached by obtaining a writ of attachment from the court and filing it in the registry of deeds or other office for recording titles, and perhaps posting notice of the attachment on the property as well. This gives notice to the world that the court has assumed jurisdiction over the property and might enter an order affecting its title. For tangible personal assets, the property may be taken into custody by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of attachment issued by the court, or a keeper appointed to retain control of the property pending further order from the court. Attachment provided an alternative means to satisfy claims of local citizens when the defendant could not be sued there in personam. Suppose, for example, that Neff hired Mitchell, an Oregon lawyer, to represent him in a divorce case in Oregon, but moved to California without paying Mitchell�s fee. Under the jurisdictional principles of Pennoyer v. Neff,  Neff could not be sued in personam in Oregon, since he could not be served with process there. However, if he had left property in the state, the court could assert jurisdiction over that property by attaching it. It could then adjudicate Mitchell�s fees claim, and if it concluded that Neff owed the fee (or if Neff defaulted), it could order Neff�s property sold to satisfy Mitchell�s claim. Thus, in rem jurisdiction provided an alternative means of satisfying a claim, if the defendant had obligingly left property subject to attachment in the forum state. Often, however, the in rem alternative would not be fully satisfactory. Because the court�s authority to adjudicate was based on its seizure of property, not power over the defendant personally, it could only dispose of the property before it. If the court determined that Mitchell was owed $300, but Neff�s attached property sold for $200, the court could not enter an order requiring Neff to pay the other $100. To do so would be to exercise jurisdiction over Neff personally, but Neff wasn�t before the court; only the property was. So, the in rem remedy was limited to the value of the property the court had attached at the outset of the case. 1 Even if the property was worth less than the plaintiff�s claim, however, an in rem action placed the defendant in a difficult position. Consider the following example.",

Neff claims that he had already paid the fee, but Mitchell claims that his payment was for other services. Neff lives in California and cannot be served with process in Oregon. However, he had left his Model T in the garage at his brother�s house in Bend, Oregon. Mitchell obtains a writ of attachment and has the Model T, worth $6,000, seized by the sheriff. Neff receives notice of the suit and the attachment, and consults you for advice on how to respond to the suit and the attachment. Which advice would be most appropriate?",

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: Since Neff isn't subject to personal jurisdiction in Oregon because he's outside the state, ignoring the action won't affect anything about the validity of the proceedings against him. Therefore, options A and B aren't viable choices.\n\n\nStep 2: Filing a special appearance under option C wouldn't make sense here either, because even though Neff contests the court's ability to hear this matter due to lack of personal jurisdiction, he does have property in the state which the court has attached - thus giving them some basis for asserting jurisdiction over something related to him.\n\n\nStep 3: Option D suggests appearing and defending the underlying claim, which seems like the best course of action given these circumstances. By doing so, Neff gets to contest whether he actually owes Mitchell money, rather than simply having his car confiscated. Furthermore, if he loses the lawsuit, he'll know exactly what amount he needs to pay back, whereas with just the in rem proceeding, he'd risk being forced to sell off more valuable items beyond just the Model T.\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "The three types of in rem jurisdiction. As if these matters aren�t complex enough, courts have recognized several different types of in rem jurisdiction. Let�s start with ��true�� in rem jurisdiction. A true in rem proceeding is one that seeks to adjudicate the title to specific property, as against all possible claimants, known and unknown. Two examples are an action to clear the title to real property, and a probate proceeding to settle an estate. In each of these situations, the court is asked to determine the ownership of specific property, ��to reach a conclusive determination of all claims to the thing so that it may be transferred to, or confirmed in the hands of, a person who will then hold it free and clear of all claims.�� Restatement (Second) of Judgments, �6, cmt. b. Suppose, for example, that the title to a piece of real estate is disputed, and the owner wishes to sell it. She might bring an action to determine title to the property, give notice to known claimants individually, and publish notice to unknown claimants (the best notice possible to unknown parties who might hold an interest in the property). The court would then determine all interests in the property, so that it could be conveyed with a clear title. Any other claims to the property, known or unknown, would be extinguished by the court�s decree. Another example of a ��pure�� in rem action is an action to forfeit property to the government. Forfeiture is used by the federal government, for example, to obtain title to goods imported illegally, and, more recently, property used in or purchased with the proceeds of drug transactions. In forfeiture actions, the property itself is ��the defendant.�� These cases end up in the reporters with names like  ��United States v. 23 Cases of Jack Daniels Whiskey,��  or, to cite an actual case,  United States v. Cadillac Sedan Deville,  933 F.2d 1010 (6th Cir. 1991). Here again, the purpose of the action is to confirm the government�s title to the subject property. The property is both the subject of the action and the source of the court�s authority to adjudicate. The court proceeds even if it lacks personal jurisdiction over some or all claimants to the property, since it has power over the property based on its presence in the district. Such in rem forfeiture actions remain common today. See generally M. Harrington, ��Rethinking  In Rem:  The Supreme Court�s New (and Misguided) Approach to Civil Forfeiture,�� 12 Yale L. & Pol�y Rev. 281 (1994). A second type of in rem jurisdiction is often referred to as ��quasi in rem jurisdiction,�� or ��quasi in rem type I jurisdiction.�� See  Shaffer v. Heitner , 433 U.S. 186, 199 n.17 (1977). This type also involves disputes as to title to property. Unlike pure in rem jurisdiction, however, the action only seeks to ��secure a preexisting claim in the subject property and to extinguish or establish the nonexistence of similar interests of particular persons.�� Id. In other words, in this type of action the party bringing the action asserts that, ��as to this particular parcel of land, or this automobile, Smith, my interest is superior to yours.�� It does not affect  other  potential claimants� interests in the property, but simply seeks a declaration that, as between the party bringing the action and a particular other contender, the plaintiff�s claim is superior. An example is an action to foreclose a mortgage. In a foreclosure action, the bank does not seek to have all other interests in the property determined or extinguished. It simply seeks a decree that its interest in the mortgaged property is superior to the mortgagor�s, due to nonpayment, and an order for sale of the property to satisfy its superior claim. As in ��true�� in rem cases, the parties to a type I action assert  preexisting  claims to the property before the court, and ask the court to sort those preexisting claims out. The third type, called ��quasi in rem type II jurisdiction,�� or ��attachment jurisdiction,�� is analytically different. In a case commenced by attachment, the party bringing the action has a claim against the defendant  having nothing to do with the property attached.  ��In attachment jurisdiction, the basis of jurisdiction is the existence of property owned by the defendant. Attachment jurisdiction is also to be contrasted with in rem jurisdiction, where the purpose of the action is to resolve conflicting claims to the property; in attachment jurisdiction both parties accept that the property is owned by defendant but plaintiff wants to expropriate it to pay his [unrelated] claim.�� Ehrenzweig, Louisell & Hazard,  Jurisdiction in a Nutshell, State and Federal  40-41 (4th ed. 1980). For example, Mitchell might bring a quasi in rem type II action against Neff in Oregon to recover the legal fees for his work on Neff�s divorce. Unable to obtain jurisdiction over Neff personally, he might attach land Neff owned in Oregon. He does not seek the attachment to assert any preexisting interest in the land; indeed, the very reason to attach it is that Neff does own it. Instead, Mitchell asks the court to exert jurisdiction over the property to establish a basis for the court to adjudicate the unrelated fees claim. The seizure of the land through attachment gives the court a jurisdictional base and an asset to sell to satisfy Mitchell�s fees claim. Similarly, Ortiz, seeking contract damages for Neff�s failure to deliver goods under a contract, might sue Neff and attach Neff�s property, to give the court a basis to adjudicate the unrelated contract claim. In these cases, the party bringing the action, unable to sue the defendant in personam, resorts to the alternative illustrated by  Question 4 . He sues the defendant and seeks seizure of her property, to give the court a basis to adjudicate a claim unrelated to the attached property. The property is not the subject of the action, it is a hostage for the defendant. Consider the following example on the three types of in rem jurisdiction.",
            "Question": "5. Quasi-distinctions.  Which of the following cases involves an exercise of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux�s house in Iowa. She brings an action against Roux in Iowa for her injuries and serves him personally with notice of the action. B.  Ohora is injured in Iowa in a collision with Roux, from Iowa. She brings an action against Roux in Nebraska for her injuries, and obtains a writ of attachment in the action on a Nebraska farm owned by Roux. C.  Ohora, a Nebraska lawyer, is hired by Roux, from Iowa, to represent him in acquiring a farm in Nebraska. Roux leaves the state and fails to pay Ohora for her services. Ohora sues him for her fee in Nebraska and has him served with notice of the action in Iowa. D.  Consolidated Equipment Company sells Roux a construction crane in Iowa, on an installment contract, subject to a right of repossession for nonpayment. Roux fails to pay. Consolidated brings an action in Nebraska to repossess the crane, and obtains a writ from the court attaching the crane while it is at a job site in Nebraska.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To identify which of the options represents an exercise of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, we need to understand what characterizes such jurisdiction. Quasi in rem type II jurisdiction occurs when a party cannot serve process on the defendant personally because they are outside the forum state's territorial limits, yet still attempts to seize their assets within the forum state to secure a judgment related to a separate claim.\n\nStep 2: Option A describes a situation where service was made personally upon Roux in Iowa, eliminating the necessity for seizing assets via attachment. Therefore, this scenario doesn't fit the definition of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Option B illustrates a classic instance of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction. Since Ohora obtained a writ of attachment on a Nebraska farm owned by Roux after serving him personally in another state wasn't feasible, this meets the criteria for quasi in rem type II jurisdiction.\n\nStep 4: Option C shows that although Roux left the state, he was eventually served personally in Iowa regarding the lawsuit filed by Ohora in Nebraska. Thus, there isn't a need for attachment here either, making it not representative of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction.\n\nStep 5: Option D discusses an action brought by Consolidated Equipment Company to repossess a construction crane sold on an installment contract. While this involves a dispute over property rights, the primary focus remains on resolving the contractual obligation rather than using the property as leverage for an unrelated claim. Hence, this scenario aligns closer with quasi in rem type I jurisdiction.",

            "Context": "The impact of  Shaffer v. Heitner Over the years from  Pennoyer v. Neff  to  Shaffer v. Heitner,  attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically ��present�� in a particular place. Harris v. Balk,  198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In  Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris�s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris�s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be ��seized�� in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris�s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein�s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein�s claim. Shaffer  involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company�s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, �169 (1975). So, Heitner sought�and was granted�a court order seizing (��sequestering��) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in  Harris v. Balk,  Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court�s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff�s ploy in  Harris,  this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction�very type II. In  Shaffer,  the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases ��supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.�� 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants� property was merely an ��elliptical way�� of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: ��We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in  International Shoe  and its progeny.�� 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from  Shaffer  means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let�s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.",
            "Question": "6.  Shaffer  survivors?  In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court�s decision in  Shaffer v. Heitner ?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux�s summer house in Nebraska. She sues Roux in Nebraska for her injuries and asserts jurisdiction by obtaining a writ of attachment on the property on which she was injured. B.  Ohora brings an action to quiet title to her Nebraska farm in a Nebraska court. She gives notice of the action by mail to Roux, who lives in New York but claims a one-third interest in the farm inherited from a great aunt. She also gives notice by publication to unknown claimants to the property. C.  Consolidated Equipment Company sells Roux a construction crane in Iowa, on an installment contract, subject to a right of repossession for nonpayment. Roux fails to pay. Consolidated brings an action in Nebraska to obtain clear title to the crane, and obtains a writ from the court attaching the crane while present on a job in Nebraska. D.  All of the above. E.  None of the above.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether each scenario allows proper assertion of jurisdiction post-Shaffer v. Heitner, we need to evaluate if the circumstances meet the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny. These standards require that the defendant have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n\nStep 2: Option A involves a situation where Ohora seeks to attach property located within the state of Nebraska where the injury occurred. However, since the injury happened outside of the state's borders, it may raise questions about the propriety of applying the laws of Nebraska to the case. Nevertheless, considering the fact that the accident took place in Nebraska, it might still pass muster due to the presence of the property within the state.\n\nStep 3: Moving on to Option B, here Ohora attempts to quiet title to her Nebraska farm through a lawsuit filed in the same state. Although she serves notice to Roux via mail and publishes notice to potential unknown claimants, the key issue lies in determining whether this meets the requirements for personal jurisdiction over Roux. Since Roux resides in New York and has no apparent connections to Nebraska aside from claiming an inheritance related to the land, it seems unlikely that this alone would suffice for personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 4: Next, looking at Option C, Consolidated Equipment Company files a lawsuit in Nebraska seeking possession of a construction crane sold to Roux on an installment plan. They secure a writ of attachment on the crane currently situated in Nebraska. Given that the crane is being repossessed due to non-payment, this appears more like an exercise of in rem jurisdiction rather than personal jurisdiction over Roux himself.\n\nStep 5: Based on our evaluation, Options A and C seem most likely to comply with the standards established in International Shoe and its progeny, especially given their direct ties to specific properties within the states' jurisdictions.",

Heitner regarding attachment jurisdiction.\n\n\nStep 2: Scenario A presents a situation where Ohora seeks to sue Roux in Nebraska for injuries sustained during a visit to his summer home in the state. By obtaining a writ of attachment on the property where the incident occurred, Ohora aims to establish jurisdiction over Roux. Considering the facts, this scenario aligns closely with the concept of attachment jurisdiction as discussed in Shaffer v. Heitner, particularly in relation to the seizure of tangible assets within the state.\n\n\nStep 3: Moving to Scenario B, Ohora initiates a lawsuit in Nebraska to quiet title to her farm, serving notice to Roux, who resides in New York and claims an interest in the property through inheritance. While this scenario touches upon concepts of real estate law and service of process, it doesn't directly involve the kind of attachment jurisdiction addressed in Shaffer v. Heitner.\n\n\nStep 4: Examining Scenario C, Consolidated Equipment Company pursues a lawsuit in Nebraska to reclaim a construction crane sold to Roux on an installment basis, securing a writ of attachment on the crane currently in Nebraska. Similar to Scenario A, this situation revolves around the seizure of tangible goods within the state, fitting within the context of attachment jurisdiction as per Shaffer v. Heitner.\n\n\nStep 5: After evaluating the scenarios, Scenarios A and C appear to best fit the criteria outlined in Shaffer v.

            "Context": "The need for a constitutional and a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction Let�s start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court�s power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property ��without due process of law,�� that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it�s a court that�s doing the depriving�by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it�basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have ��a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction�� over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as  International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler ,  Asahi ,  Burnham v. Superior Court , and  Bristol-Myers Squibb , the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state, 1  being ��at home�� in a state, 2  minimum contacts that give rise to the claim, 3  and service of process on an individual in the forum state. 4  That�s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets  limits  on the exercise of jurisdiction. (��No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.��) It says to the states, ��go ahead, define your courts� jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don�t overreach.�� It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, 5  and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant�s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps.  First,  they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant.  Second,  if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause.

            "Context": "The need for a constitutional and a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction Let�s start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court�s power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property ��without due process of law,�� that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it�s a court that�s doing the depriving�by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it�basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have ��a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction�� over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as  International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler ,  Asahi ,  Burnham v. Superior Court , and  Bristol-Myers Squibb , the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state, 1  being ��at home�� in a state, 2  minimum contacts that give rise to the claim, 3  and service of process on an individual in the forum state. 4  That�s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets  limits  on the exercise of jurisdiction.

So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant.

            "Context": "Long-arm statutes and specific jurisdiction So, in most situations, if a court is to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, doing so must be authorized by a statute. In a fair number of states, those statutes are modeled on the Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act. 6  These statutes authorize the local courts to exercise jurisdiction based on particular types of contacts with the forum state. These contacts often include transacting business in the state, contracting to supply goods or services in the state, committing a tortious act in the state, owning property in the state, and others. If the defendant did one of these things in the state, and that conduct gives rise to a claim, the plaintiff is authorized to bring the claim in the courts of the state. These statutes, in other words, authorize the state�s courts to exercise ��specific�� in personam jurisdiction�that is, jurisdiction over claims that arise out of the defendant�s purposeful acts focused on the state.

Quantus negotiated a separate contract with Tawney & Hughes�s managing partner, in Connecticut, to build a system for their main office in Connecticut. The Connecticut system never worked right. Tawney & Hughes sues Quantus for breach of contract, seeking damages for the faulty system, in a Vermont state court. Assume that the Vermont long-arm statute authorizes suits that ��arise out of (1) transacting any business in the state; (2) contracting to supply goods or services in the state; or (3) committing a tortious act in the state.��",

For the first basis - transactional activity - we see that Quantus sold software to clients across multiple states including Vermont. However, since the sale was not specifically made in Vermont, this does not meet the requirements of the statute.\n\nStep 3: Moving on to the second basis - contractual obligations - we find that Quantus had an agreement with both Marshall & Story and Tawney & Hughes.

            "Context": "A perennial confuser: ��Tortious acts within the state��. Some procedure teachers assign  Gray v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,  176 N.E.2d 761 (Ill. 1961), as an example of a court grappling with a long-arm statute. In  Gray,  the defendant Titan Valve Company made a water heater valve in Ohio and sold it to American Radiator in Pennsylvania. American Radiator incorporated the valve into a water heater that was sold through the ��stream of commerce�� into Illinois. Later, the heater exploded in Mrs. Gray�s Illinois home, injuring her. The Illinois long-arm statute authorized jurisdiction if the defendant ��commits a tortious act within this state.�� The  Gray  court held that Titan had ��committed a tortious act�� in Illinois, because the valve had caused  an injury  in Illinois, and an act does not become a ��tortious act�� until the plaintiff suffers injury. Thus, Titan was subject to suit in Illinois under this long-arm provision, although it had not actually done any act in Illinois. This is a mighty broad interpretation of the commits-a-tortious-act phrase. The New York Court of Appeals rejected this extravagant interpretation shortly after the  Gray  decision. It held that, under similar language in New York�s statute, the defendant must do the negligent act in the state to ��commit a tortious act�� there. See  Feathers v. McLucas, 21 App. Div. 2d 558 (N.Y. App. Div. 1964). But the Illinois courts are the final word on the meaning of the Illinois statute. If the Illinois Supreme Court says that the tortious act happens where the injury occurs, that�s where it happens . . . for purposes of applying Illinois�s statute. But, of course, the question still remains whether, assuming a case falls within a long-arm statute that has been broadly construed by the state�s courts, it would be constitutional to apply that statute in a particular case. No matter how Illinois chooses to construe its own statute, the  constitutional  question remains. So let�s try an example applying the Illinois long-arm statute in a tort case.",

He drives it to Illinois, where he has an accident, and the driver�s air bag fails to deploy, aggravating his injuries. Robertson believes the dealership was negligent in preparing the air bag before selling him the car. He sues Jackson�s in an Illinois state court, basing jurisdiction on the provision of Illinois�s long-arm statute that authorizes jurisdiction if the defendant ��commits a tortious act in Illinois.�� The Illinois Supreme Court, as we know, has interpreted this statute broadly in  Gray v. American Radiator .",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over Robertson�s case, because Jackson�s negligent act took place in Florida. B.  The long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction in Robertson�s case, but it would be unconstitutional for the court to require Jackson to defend this case in Illinois. C.  The long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction over Robertson�s case, because Robertson�s injury took place in Illinois. Because the suit is brought in the Illinois court, and satisfies Illinois�s long-arm statute, the suit is proper. D.  The long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction in Robertson�s case, and it will not offend due process for the court to exercise jurisdiction.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, consider what the Illinois long-arm statute requires - that the defendant commit a tortious act in Illinois. As per the given information, the Illinois Supreme Court has already ruled in Gray v. American Radiator that committing a tortious act means causing harm in Illinois, even if no actual action occurred in the state.\n\nStep 2: Now, analyze the facts presented in the problem regarding Robertson's lawsuit against Jackson's Audi. According to these facts, Robertson bought an Audi from Jackson's Audi in Florida and drove it to Illinois, where he got involved in an accident. His injuries were exacerbated when the driver's side airbag failed to deploy properly during the crash.\n\nStep 3: Based on the scenario described above, determine which party committed a tortious act in Illinois. Since Robertson suffered physical harm in Illinois due to the malfunctioning airbag, it could be argued that Jackson's Audi did indeed cause a tortious act in Illinois.\n\n\nStep 4: Next, evaluate whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Jackson's Audi in Illinois would violate their right to due process. Given that they have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state (i.e., having sold cars to residents who then traveled back to Illinois), it might seem reasonable to allow them to be sued in Illinois.\n\n\nStep 5: However, since the specific details about Jackson's Audi's business operations and connections to Illinois aren't mentioned, assume that they don't have significant ties to the state beyond simply selling vehicles to out-of-state customers like Robertson.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Consider whether requiring Jackson's Audi to litigate in Illinois would unfairly burden them considering their lack of substantial connections to the state. While some argue that modern technology allows companies to easily participate remotely in lawsuits across different jurisdictions, others counter that such requirements may impose undue hardship on defendants without meaningful connections to the forum state.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Weigh the competing interests at play here – ensuring access to justice for plaintiffs versus protecting defendants' rights to fair treatment under the law.\n\n\n\nStep 8: Finally, decide whether allowing the Illinois court to hear Robertson's case against Jackson's Audi aligns with fundamental principles of fairness and justice.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "Another confuser: Constitutional and statutory limits on personal jurisdiction in the federal courts Most of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a  state  court�s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it�s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court�s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment�s Due Process Clause, which provides, ��nor shall any  State  deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law�� (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O�Brien Law Firm , 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice & Procedure  �1068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States. 7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support ��nationwide jurisdiction�� over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule. 8  In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): ��Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .�� Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won�t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. �1361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception. In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable ��long-arm statute�� for the federal courts. Here�s a question to illustrate the point.",

C.  The federal court should deny the motion if exercising jurisdiction over Jason would be constitutional under Fourteenth Amendment analysis. D.  The federal court should deny the motion, because a federal court has the constitutional power to hear claims against a defendant who has contacts anywhere in the United States. E.

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to determine whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction over Jason. Since the lawsuit was removed from state court to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, the rules governing personal jurisdiction in the federal court mirror those of the state court in which the original complaint was filed - here, Arizona.\n\n\nStep 2: To establish personal jurisdiction in Arizona state court, both the long-arm statute and the Constitution's Due Process Clause must be satisfied. If either requirement is met, the court has personal jurisdiction over Jason.\n\n\nStep 3: We know that the Arizona long-arm statute allows for personal jurisdiction when the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the state and the assertion of jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\n\n\nStep 4: Now let us consider the options given:\n\n\nOption A suggests denying the motion if the courts of Arizona would have personal jurisdiction over Jason under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Arizona long-arm statute. Option B proposes denying the motion if the Arizona long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment for the federal court to require Jason to defend the suit in Arizona. Options C, D, and E suggest different criteria for determining whether the federal court should deny the motion.\n\n\nStep 5: Given our understanding of how personal jurisdiction works in the federal system, particularly regarding removal actions, we recognize that once a case is properly before the federal court through removal, the federal court exercises the same level of personal jurisdiction as the state court in which the original complaint was filed. Therefore, the key issue becomes what standard governs personal jurisdiction in the Arizona state court.\n\n\nStep 6: As stated earlier, the Arizona long-arm statute requires two things: first, that there be sufficient minimum contacts between Jason and the state of Arizona, and second, that asserting jurisdiction comply with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. These requirements align closely with the standards used in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\n\nStep 7: Because the federal court mirrors the state court's personal jurisdiction standards after removal, we look at these factors to decide whether the federal court should grant or deny Jason's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\nStep 8: Based on the information above, we conclude that the best approach is to follow the state court's personal jurisdiction standards, specifically focusing on the combination of the long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\n\nStep 9: With all considerations taken into account, we find that the proper way to evaluate Jason's motion involves considering whether the Arizona long-arm statute permits personal jurisdiction and whether doing so satisfies the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\n\nStep 10: By following this method, we arrive at the determination that the federal court should deny Jason's motion if the courts of Arizona would have personal jurisdiction over him under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Arizona long-arm statute.",

Consider the following question, which illustrates the problem with interpreting all long-arm statutes to ��go to the limits of due process.��\n\n So what does this ��limits of due process�� language mean, if it doesn�t mean that the court will take jurisdiction over any case that it constitutionally can? Appropriately understood, it means that the court will construe the specific provisions of its long-arm statute as broadly as possible without overreaching constitutional bounds. If language in the statute might be interpreted one way to support jurisdiction, and another to deny it, the court will opt for the broadest interpretation consistent with due process constraints. A second example may help to make the distinction.�",
            "Question": "8. Double trouble.  Ausable Motors Corporation manufactures motors for industrial machinery. It makes its motors in Louisiana, and sells them to various wholesalers, including Sunday River Distributors in Kentucky. Ausable�s contract with Sunday River requires Sunday River to solicit sales of Ausable motors in Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, and allows Ausable to cancel the contract if Sunday River fails to sell at least one hundred motors in each of these states each year. Sunday River resells a substantial quantity of Ausable motors into Tennessee each year. Twelve of them are sold to Delta Retooling, a company in Nashville, Tennessee. While Lemmon is using an Ausable motor at Delta�s Nashville shop, a belt flies off the flywheel and injures his eye. He sues Ausable in Tennessee. Assume that the Tennessee long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction for a claim ��arising out of the transaction of business within the state,�� and that the Tennessee courts interpret the Tennessee long-arm statute to ��go to the limits of due process.�� Ausable moves to dismiss Lemmon�s suit for lack of personal jurisdiction.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The court will likely conclude that Ausable is subject to personal jurisdiction under the ��transacting business�� provision of the long-arm statute, and that it would be constitutional to exercise jurisdiction over Ausable. B.  The case will likely be dismissed for failure to satisfy the long-arm statute. C.  The case will likely be dismissed because it would be unconstitutional to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ausable in this case.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand the meaning of the phrase \"the long-arm statute goes to the limits of due process.\" This phrase suggests that the court will consider whether exercising jurisdiction over the defendant would violate their rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nStep 2: Since the Tennessee long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction for claims arising out of the transaction of business within the state, we need to determine whether Ausable's activities in Tennessee meet this requirement.\n\nStep 3: We also know that the Tennessee courts interpret their long-arm statute to go to the limits of due process, which implies that they will construe the statutory requirements broadly but still stay within constitutional boundaries.\n\nStep 4: Given that Ausable contracted with Sunday River to require them to solicit sales of Ausable motors in Tennessee, and that Sunday River actually resold a significant number of those motors into Tennessee, including twelve to Delta Retooling in Nashville, it seems plausible that Ausable could be considered to be doing business in Tennessee through its contractual relationship with Sunday River.\n\nStep 5: However, even if Ausable meets the technical requirements of the long-arm statute, there remains the issue of whether exercising jurisdiction over Ausable would pass constitutional muster.\n\nStep 6: To assess this, we should examine factors such as minimum contacts between Ausable and Tennessee, fairness to both parties, and other considerations related to the Due Process Clause.\n\nStep 7: Considering these points, let us evaluate the options presented.",

            "Context": "The special appearance and the motion to dismiss The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she�s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You�d feel the same way. ��Hey, wait! This case doesn�t belong here; throw it out.�� All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court�s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the ��special appearance.�� The defendant would ��appear specially�� for the sole purpose of objecting to the court�s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before  Pennoyer,  courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court�s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court�s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have ��appeared generally,�� waiving her special appearance and accepting the court�s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g.,  Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada,  629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff�s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a ��special appearance�� had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court�s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising  all of her defenses on the merits,  and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there�s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant�s  first response  to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in  Chapter 18  on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn�t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should�very carefully�enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here�s a question to test the point. I�ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you�ve read the discussion above it should be easy.",

        {
            "Context": "So, the defendant, if he does it right, can come into the court where the case is filed and object to jurisdiction. Ito, for example, if he navigates the special appearance rules carefully, could raise his objection in the Nevada court and have the judge decide it before considering the merits of the case. Suppose that he does, and the court rules that it has jurisdiction over him. What should Ito do next? If the court holds that Ito is subject to jurisdiction, it will naturally proceed to litigate the claim. If Ito stalks off in a huff and refuses to participate���defaults,�� in the language of civil procedure�the court will enter a default judgment for the plaintiff, which will very likely be enforceable in that state or in others. (More on that later.) You wouldn�t advise Ito to do that. Instead, you might suggest that he take an immediate appeal of the judge�s finding that he is subject to jurisdiction there. If he could get the Nevada appellate court to reverse the trial judge�s ruling, and order the case dismissed, he would at least avoid litigating the merits of the underlying claim in Nevada. Thinking of a law suit as a time line, Ito would rather obtain review of the jurisdictional finding at Point  A  rather than having to litigate the case on the merits and then appeal (if he loses on the merits) at the much later Point  B . If he can�t take an immediate appeal, he will end up doing exactly what he believes he shouldn�t have to: litigating in the Nevada court. In many cases, this could take several years, and involve expensive discovery and a full trial on the merits. Some states do allow a defendant to immediately appeal the trial court�s decision that it has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. But other states, and the federal courts, take the view that this decision is ��interlocutory���part of an ongoing process in the trial court�that cannot be reviewed until the case is litigated to a final judgment in the trial court. See, e.g.,  IHT Corp. v. Paragon Cutlery Co.,  794 A.2d 651, 653 (Me. 2002). There�s a good argument for this no-interlocutory- appeal approach. A trial judge makes many decisions in the course of a case. One of the parties�the one who loses on the issue�probably objects to most of these. If the loser could appeal each such decision, the case would bounce back and forth between the trial and the appellate courts repeatedly, causing delay and expense to the parties. And remember that many of those decisions along the way will not end up being crucial to the outcome of the case. After all, most cases settle. And the party who loses on one issue may still win the case on another. For example, the court might hold that it has jurisdiction over Ito, but later accept his argument that the limitations period for the claim had passed. If so, he would have no reason to seek review of the jurisdictional decision. For a variety of reasons, many contested issues fall by the wayside before the case is resolved, so it may not be wise to allow immediate review. So, the answer here is that the answer varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some states, Ito could obtain immediate review of the trial judge�s decision that he is subject to jurisdiction, without having to litigate the merits of the case in the trial court first. In others, and in the federal courts, he would have to litigate the case on the merits in the trial court and then appeal the jurisdictional finding if he loses on the merits. In these courts, however, he does not waive his objection by litigating the case in the trial court. (That would be a tough rule, wouldn�t it, since once the trial court finds that it has jurisdiction, Ito really has no choice but to stay and litigate the case.) If he loses the case on the merits, he may still appeal the jurisdiction question at Point  B , after the case reaches final judgment. Let�s illustrate this with a thorny question.",
            "Question": "2. Appealing options.  Assume that Ervin brings his action for fraudulent misrepresentation against Ito in Emporia, a state that follows the Federal Rules approach to jurisdictional objections and does not allow interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional rulings. Ito, believing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him, answers Ervin�s complaint, denying the allegations of fraud, raising a statute of limitations defense, and objecting to the court�s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him for the claim. The court holds a hearing on Ito�s jurisdictional objection, and rules that he is subject to jurisdiction for Ervin�s claim. Consequently, it refuses to dismiss the case. Ito therefore defends the case on the merits. After trial, the jury concludes that his representations were fraudulent, that the suit was not barred by the statute of limitations, and awards damages to Ervin. Final judgment is entered for Ervin.",

Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for Ervin�s claim, it will order the case dismissed. Ervin will have to bring a new action in a state that does have jurisdiction over Ito for the claim, and relitigate the case. D.  Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, it will order the case dismissed. However, the parties will not relitigate the case.

            "updated_reasoning": "---\n# Legal Context\nThe defendant, if he does it right, can come into the court where the case is filed and object to jurisdiction. Ito, for example, if he navigates the special appearance rules carefully, could raise his objection in the Nevada court and have the judge decide it before considering the merits of the case. Suppose that he does, and the court rules that it has jurisdiction over him. What should Ito do next? If the court holds that Ito is subject to jurisdiction, it will naturally proceed to litigate the claim. If Ito stalks off in a huff and refuses to participate���defaults,�� in the language of civil procedure�the court will enter a default judgment for the plaintiff, which will very likely be enforceable in that state or in others. (More on that later.) You wouldn�t advise Ito to do that. Instead, you might suggest that he take an immediate appeal of the judge�s finding that he is subject to jurisdiction there. If he could get the Nevada appellate court to reverse the trial judge�s ruling, and order the case dismissed, he would at least avoid litigating the case on the merits in Nevada. Thinking of a law suit as a time line, Ito would rather obtain review of the jurisdictional finding at Point  A  rather than having to litigate the case on the merits and then appeal (if he loses on the merits) at the much later Point  B. If he can�t take an immediate appeal, he will end up doing exactly what he believes he shouldn�t have to: litigating in the Nevada court. In many cases, this could take several years, and involve expensive discovery and a full trial on the merits. Some states do allow a defendant to immediately appeal the trial court�s decision that it has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. But other states, and the federal courts, take the view that this decision is ��interlocutory���part of an ongoing process in the trial court–that cannot be reviewed until the case is litigated to a final judgment in the trial court. See, e.g.,  IHT Corp. v. Paragon Cutlery Co.,  794 A.2d 651, 653 (Me. 2002). There’s a good argument for this no-interlocutory-appeal approach. A trial judge makes many decisions in the course of a case. One of the parties—the one who loses on the issue— probably objects to most of these. If the loser could appeal each such decision, the case would bounce back and forth between the trial and the appellate courts repeatedly, causing delay and expense to the parties. And remember that many of those decisions along the way will not end up being crucial to the outcome of the case. After all, most cases settle. And the party who loses on one issue may still win the case on another. For example, the court might hold that it has jurisdiction over Ito, but later accept his argument that the limitations period for the claim had passed. If so, he would have no reason to seek review of the jurisdictional decision. For a variety of reasons, many contested issues fall by the wayside before the case is resolved, so it may not be wise to allow immediate review. So, the answer here is that the answer varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some states, Ito could obtain immediate review of the trial judge’s decision that he is subject to jurisdiction, without having to litigate the case on the merits in the trial court first. In others, and in the federal courts, he would have to litigate the case on the merits in the trial court and then appeal the jurisdictional finding if he loses on the merits. In these courts, however, he does not waive his objection by litigating the case in the trial court. (That would be a tough rule, wouldn’t it, since once the trial court finds that it has jurisdiction, Ito really has no choice but to stay and litigate the case.)\n\nIf he loses the case on the merits, he may still appeal the jurisdiction question at Point  B, after the case reaches final judgment. Let’s illustrate this with a thorny question.2. Appealing options.  Assume that Ervin brings his action for fraudulent misrepresentation against Ito in Emporia, a state that follows the Federal Rules approach to jurisdictional objections and does not allow interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional rulings. Ito, believing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him, answers Ervin’s complaint, denying the allegations of fraud, raising a statute of limitations defense, and objecting to the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him for the claim. The court holds a hearing on Ito’s jurisdictional objection, and rules that he is subject to jurisdiction for Ervin’s claim. Consequently, it refuses to dismiss the case. Ito therefore defends the case on the merits. After trial, the jury concludes that his representations were fraudulent, that the suit was not barred by the statute of limitations, and awards damages to Ervin. Final judgment is entered for Ervin.Options: A.  Ito may not appeal the jurisdictional ruling. He waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising it in the answer with other defenses on the merits. B.  Ito may not appeal the jurisdictional ruling. He waived his objection by litigating the case on the merits. He should have defaulted, allowed a final default judgment to enter for Ervin, and appealed on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to render it. C.  Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for Ervin’s claim, it will order the case dismissed. Ervin will have to bring a new action in a state that does have jurisdiction over Ito for the claim, and relitigate the case. D.  Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, it will order the case dismissed. However, the parties will not relitigate the case. Ervin will sue Ito in a state that does have jurisdiction over him. That court will enter a judgment based on the findings by the jury in the Emporia suit.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the situation presented in the problem\nIto is facing a lawsuit brought by Ervin in Emporia, a state that follows the Federal Rules approach to jurisdictional objections and does not allow interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional rulings. Ito objected to the court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over him for the claim, but the court ruled that he is subject to jurisdiction.\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the implications of the court's ruling\nSince Emporia does not allow interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional rulings, Ito cannot immediately appeal the court's decision regarding personal jurisdiction. This means he must continue to defend the case on its merits.\n\n## Step 3: Considering the potential consequences of losing the case on its merits\nIf Ito loses the case on its merits, he may still appeal the jurisdictional question at a later point, specifically after the case reaches final judgment.\n\n## Step 4: Evaluating the available options for appealing the jurisdictional ruling\nGiven that Ito did not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction by",

            "Context": "Challenging jurisdiction in the enforcing court. A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won�t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito�s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a ��judgment on the judgment�� in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin�s judgment. An Acadia court would not order ��execution�� on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito�s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin�s the plaintiff, Ito�s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other�s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito�s assets sold to satisfy his judgment. 1 However,  states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito�s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before  Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter.

Emporia uses the common law special appearance approach to challenging personal jurisdiction. Ito is served in Acadia with the complaint and summons in the action. On counsel�s advice that he is not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for this claim, Ito ignores the suit. After obtaining a default judgment in the Emporia action, Ervin brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito is served with the complaint and summons in this enforcement action in Acadia. He appears, and raises the defense that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin�s claim. Consequently, Ito argues, the Emporia judgment is not entitled to full faith and credit.",

The Acadia court will not consider whether the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, because Ito failed to make a special appearance to challenge jurisdiction in the Emporia court. D.  If the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over Ito, it will proceed to adjudicate the merits of Ervin�s fraud claim.",

Instead, Ervin needs to obtain a judgment on the judgment in the state where Ito resides, which is Acadia.\n\nStep 3: To get around this issue, Ervin files a second lawsuit in Acadia, known as a �judgment-on-the-judgment� case, requesting that the Acadia court enter a judgment on the Emporia judgment. \n\nStep 4: Now let's analyze the situation presented in the multiple-choice options. Option A suggests that if the Acadia court finds that the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, then it should allow entry of judgment on the Emporia judgment. This seems plausible at first glance but requires further scrutiny.\n\nStep 5: Upon closer examination, however, we see that even though the Emporia court assumed jurisdiction over Ito through service of process, Ito still maintains the ability to contest the validity of that assumption in the subsequent enforcement proceeding in Acadia.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, regardless of whether the Acadia court determines that the Emporia court possessed personal jurisdiction over Ito, Ito retains the capacity to dispute the legitimacy of the initial judgment due to potential defects in the underlying proceedings.",

Ervin now brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito is served with the complaint and summons in the action in Acadia. He appears, and argues that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him, and that he never made false representations to Ervin about the stock.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ito may raise both defenses in the Acadia enforcement action, since he did not litigate them in the Emporia court. B.  Ito may raise both defenses in the Acadia enforcement action, but the court will only hear the substantive defense to the fraud claim if it determines that the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction over Ito. C.  Ito may not raise either defense in the Acadia enforcement action, because he waived them by defaulting in the Emporia action. D.  Ito may raise the personal jurisdiction defense in the Acadia enforcement action, but not the substantive defense to the fraud claim.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand what happens when a party challenges jurisdiction in the enforcing court. According to the given text, if a defendant like Ito is sued away from home and believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim, he may choose to ignore the lawsuit altogether. By doing so, the court might assume that Ito has no defense to the claim and enter a default judgment for the plaintiff, Ervin.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's examine how the situation unfolds after the default judgment is entered. Since Ito has no property in Emporia and doesn't plan to visit the area, Ervin cannot execute the judgment directly. Instead, Ervin needs to obtain a new judgment in the state where Ito resides, known as the enforcing state. To achieve this, Ervin files a separate lawsuit called a 'judgment-on-the-judgment' action in the enforcing state.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering our specific scenario involving Ervin suing Ito for fraud related to a stock sale, we know that Ito defaulted in the original case brought in Emporia. As a result, the Emporia court entered a default judgment for Ervin. Subsequently, Ervin filed a second lawsuit in Acadia, aiming to secure a judgment on the Emporia judgment.\n\nStep 4: Given these circumstances, we should analyze whether Ito can challenge the personal jurisdiction exercised by the Emporia court during the initial lawsuit. It seems reasonable that Ito should still be permitted to contest the issue of personal jurisdiction even though he didn't initially object in the Emporia court.\n\n\nStep 5: Furthermore, regarding the substantive defense to the fraud claim, we need to determine whether Ito can also argue this point in the Acadia enforcement action. Considering the principles outlined in Pennoyer v. Neff, it appears that Ito indeed retains the ability to dispute the merits of the underlying claim, specifically the allegations of fraud.\n\n\nStep 6: Based on the information presented and the logical progression of events, we conclude that Ito can effectively raise both the personal jurisdiction defense and the substantive defense to the fraud claim within the Acadia enforcement action.",

Neff, Ito maintains the capacity to dispute the merits of the underlying claim, particularly the allegations of fraud, within the context of the Acadia enforcement action.\nStep 5: Therefore, combining these findings, we deduce that Ito can successfully raise both the personal jurisdiction defense and the substantive defense to the fraud claim within the Acadia enforcement action.",

She may challenge it at the outset of the action, by special appearance or an objection in the rendering court. Or, if she�s a risk taker, she can ignore the action in the rendering court and resist enforcement of the resulting default judgment when the plaintiff tries to enforce it in another state. So, why not try them both? Consider the following example.",
            "Question": "7. If at first you don�t succeed. . . .  Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito appears specially in the Emporia court to argue that the Emporia court lacks personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin�s claim. The court holds a hearing on Ito�s objection and rules that he is subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for the claim. Ito, unconvinced, defaults, and the court enters a default judgment for Ervin. Ervin now brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito appears, and raises the defense that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin�s claim.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The court will not determine whether Ito was subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, but Ito will be able to take an appeal on that issue in Acadia, since he defaulted on the merits in the Emporia trial court. B.  The court will enforce the judgment without allowing Ito to relitigate the jurisdictional defense. C.  The court will consider whether Ito was subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, because Ito made a proper special appearance in Emporia and defaulted on the merits in the Emporia action. D.  None of the above is true.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: When a party makes a special appearance in the original lawsuit, they're contesting the court's power to hear the case against them due to lack of personal jurisdiction. This means their primary argument isn't about the validity of the claims themselves but rather about the authority of the court to decide those claims.\n\nStep 2: In this scenario, Ito initially contests the Emporia court's jurisdiction over his person regarding Ervin's claim through a special appearance. However, after losing that battle, he then defaults on the merits, which implies he accepts the court's decision-making capacity as far as its factual findings go.\n\nStep 3: Now, considering the situation where Ito seeks to have the Emporia judgment enforced in Acadia, we need to understand how these actions affect his ability to raise objections again. Generally, once a party waives their right to object to jurisdiction by participating fully in the proceedings beyond merely raising the jurisdictional issue, such as by defending on the merits, they cannot re-litigate that point in subsequent proceedings aimed at enforcing the initial judgment.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, given that Ito participated more than just making a special appearance by eventually defaulting on the merits, he would typically forfeit the opportunity to dispute the jurisdiction anew in Acadia.",

            "Context": "Constitutional standards for adequate notice: Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person�s property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to  tell the defendant  that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called ��personal service of process.�� Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant�s home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as ��constructive service,�� as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson�s wise opinion in  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. , 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane  involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property�the right to sue the bank for mismanagement�due process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in  Mullane  was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane  held that ��an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.�� 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of  Mullane , several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in  Mullane  did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. The question below probes what it did  require.",

Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., we need to analyze the requirements set forth by the Supreme Court regarding adequate notice under the Due Process Clause.\n\n\nStep 2: According to Mullane, the key factor in determining adequacy of notice is whether it is \"reasonably calculated\" to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\n\n\nStep 3: We should examine each option in light of this standard to see which ones align with the principles outlined in Mullane.\n\n\nOption A suggests that everyone whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding. This seems overly broad because it doesn't take into account varying levels of difficulty in identifying potential claimants or the feasibility of providing direct notice to those individuals.\n\n\nOption B states that anyone whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding. While this acknowledges the importance of investigating possible claimants, it still implies a level of certainty about names and addresses that isn't always feasible in complex cases like the one presented in Mullane.\n\n\nOption C proposes that any person whose interests might be affected by the proceeding must be given notice by in-hand service of process. However, this approach ignores the practical difficulties associated with delivering physical documents directly to potentially numerous individuals when their identities aren't readily apparent.\n\n\nOption D mentions that due to the large number of people whose interests might be affected by the proceedings, notice by publication was sufficient on the facts of the case. Although this statement reflects part of the Mullane decision, it oversimplifies the holding since the Court also emphasized the role of other factors, including the availability of alternative representatives and the likelihood of effective representation within the class.\n\n\nGiven these considerations, none of the specific approaches offered in Options A-D fully capture the nuanced criteria articulated in Mullane for evaluating the adequacy of notice.",

Mullane  involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property—the right to sue the bank for mismanagement—due process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in  Mullane  was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane  held that “an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.”\n\nWhat is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of  Mullane, several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in  Mullane  did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action.\n\n\nNow here is your question:\n\n\nLeCompte brings suit against Wilkins for battery in state court.

When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person’s property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to  tell the defendant  that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called “personal service of process.” Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant’s home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as “constructive service,” as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant.

            "Context": "The separate requirements of notice and personal jurisdiction. Because Pennoyer based jurisdiction on service of process, it tended to\nblur the distinction between two constitutional requirements�adequate notice to the defendant and a basis to adjudicate. But these are separate requirements, each of which must be met. Personal jurisdiction requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state that makes it fair to require her to defend the action there. The distinct constitutional requirement of notice of the action assures that the defendant is adequately informed that a court is going to adjudicate a claim involving\nher rights. As Mullane mandates, every court system requires careful procedures to inform the defendant of the commencement of a lawsuit. This constitutional requirement is satisfied if the initial papers in the action are served on the defendant by a means reasonably calculated to actually inform her of the pendency of the action. Pennoyer v. Neff creates confusion about these requirements for three reasons. First, under Pennoyer, the same act�personal service of the papers in the action on the defendant�provided both notice of the action and a basis for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction. Notice was sufficient under the Pennoyer regime, because handing the papers to the defendant in person is more likely than any other method to actually inform her that she has been sued. And the court acquired jurisdiction, under Pennoyer�s reasoning, if service was made while the defendant was in the forum state, because the court had authority over persons and property ��seized�� within the forum state. Second, the Pennoyer opinion suggests that giving the defendant notice by publication, that is, publishing notice of the commencement of an action in a newspaper, satisfies the constitutional due process requirement to give notice of the action, at least in cases commenced by attachment. This is no longer good law. Under Mullane, publication is not sufficient to ��reasonably inform [the defendant] of the pendency of the action�� (Mullane, 339 U.S. at 315) unless no other type of notice more likely to reach her is possible. See Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams, 462 U.S. 791, 796 (1983). Generally, there are better alternatives, such as personal service or delivery through some form of mail to the defendant�s last known address. In cases against corporations, service on an officer or managing agent of the corporation will provide adequate notice to the corporation that suit has been filed against it. A third source of confusion arises from Pennoyer�s suggestion that service of process outside the state was always improper. ��Process from the tribunals of one State cannot run into another State, and summon parties there domiciled to leave its territory and respond to proceedings against them [in another state].�� 95 U.S. at 727. However, this language from Pennoyer means that such service in another state would not provide a basis for jurisdiction. It did not mean that serving the papers on the defendant in another state would not constitute adequate notice that the law suit had been filed. Today, courts commonly exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants located in other states, based on minimum contacts in the state where the suit is brought. In such cases, personal delivery of the papers notifying the defendant of the action, or some form of mail notice, provides constitutionally adequate notice of the action, even though delivered outside the forum state (the state in which the action is brought).\nThis example may help to sort out these two constitutional touchstones.",

            "Context": "More technicalities: Serving process on individual defendants in federal cases. So, Rule 4(c) mandates delivery of the summons and complaint to the defendant in federal cases, as do most state rules of civil procedure. Now, how  should the papers be delivered? For federal cases, the Federal Rules specify proper methods for serving process on different types of defendants, such as individuals, corporations, and political subdivisions. This section will focus on the methods for serving individuals. � Rule 4(e) authorizes service on an individual defendant�that is, a person�by delivering the summons and complaint to her personally. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(A). This is fairly straightforward �you take the papers to the defendant and physically give them to her. � Alternatively, you may deliver them to the individual�s home and leave them with a person of ��suitable age and discretion�� who lives there. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B). � You may also serve an individual defendant by delivering the summons and complaint to an agent authorized to receive process for the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(C). It must be a person the defendant has specifically authorized to receive process in a lawsuit or who is designated by statute as authorized to receive service, not just a person who works for the defendant or is a general agent in her business. (A defendant might have appointed an agent for service of process in a contract, for example.) � Alternatively, Rule 4(e)(1) allows you to  use state service of process methods  for the courts of the state in which the case is pending  or  for the state in which service of process is made. So, if you sue in the Eastern District of Michigan, and you are serving process on a defendant in the Eastern District of Washington, you may use the methods of service of process authorized by Michigan law for the state courts of Michigan or those authorized by Washington law for the state courts of Washington. Frequently, these state rules will allow methods not authorized by the Federal Rules, such as service by mail. See, e.g., Michigan Civil Rules 2.105(A)(2) (authorizing service by registered or certified mail). If so, a plaintiff may use these methods instead of one of the methods authorized by Rule 4(e)(2).

She serves Moe several weeks later, by having the investigator deliver the summons and complaint to Fields at his office in New York. She serves Curley by mailing the summons and complaint to Curley at his home in Michigan by first class mail. All three move to dismiss for improper service of process under Rule 12(b)(5).

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to determine whether each method used was proper according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

He was served through Fields, his booking agent, when he was present at his home in Virginia. However, this doesn't meet the requirements because Fields wasn't authorized to accept service; he was simply visiting for the weekend. Therefore, service on Larry isn't valid.\n\nStep 3: Next, consider Moe. Like Larry, he was served via Fields, but this time at his office in New York. Again, since Fields wasn't authorized to accept service, this too fails to comply with the rule.\n\nStep 4: Moving on to Curly, we see that he was mailed the summons and complaint directly. While some states permit service by mail, the Federal Rules don't explicitly authorize this method unless specified otherwise by state law. Since no exception applies here, service on Curly isn't considered valid either.\n\nStep 5: Lastly, examine West. Here, a constable delivered the documents to her office in Los Angeles after she declined receipt.

            "Context": "Service of process on a corporation under Federal Rule 4. Rule 4(h) provides several options for serving process on a corporation, when service is made in a judicial district of the United States. � Service may be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation, for example, the president, vice-president, or secretary of the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). The phrase ��delivering a copy�� means physical delivery, not mailing. � Alternatively, service may be made by delivering a copy to a managing or general agent of the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h) (1)(B). This provision is the most ambiguous part of Rule 4(h), because it is unclear who will qualify as a ��managing or general agent�� of a corporation. In deciding whether a person is a managing or general agent, the court will consider how much authority the person served has in the general management of the business at the place where service is made. The logic is that a person with broad responsibilities will more likely recognize the importance of the papers and feel a responsibility to see that the proper people find out about them and defend the case. � Service may also be made on an agent authorized by law or appointment to receive service of process for the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). Many states have statutes providing that a corporation registered to do business in the state appoints the state�s Secretary of State as its agent for service of process in actions brought against the corporation. These statutes typically require the plaintiff, if he serves process on the Secretary as agent for the corporation, to give notice by mail directly to the corporation as well. � Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(A) authorizes service ��in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an individual.�� This is confusing, because Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 4(e)(1), allows service  on an individual  by the methods of service authorized by the state where the action is pending or the state where process is actually served. Read literally, this seems to suggest that the plaintiff in a case against a corporation can use the state law methods  for serving an individual.  However, this reference is clearly intended to authorize a plaintiff to serve process on a corporation under state rules for serving  a corporation . Well, let�s probe the limits of these provisions with another question. Be sure to consult the Rule itself in testing what was done against the requirements of the Rule.",

            "Options": "Options: A.  delivering the summons and complaint to Suares, a member of the board of directors of Pourpack. B.  delivering the papers to the Utah Secretary of State, based on a Utah statute that authorizes such service in actions against a corporation arising out of its activities in Utah and mailing a copy of the papers (as required by the statute) to PourPack at its corporate address. PourPack argues that this is improper because Girardi�s claim arises under federal law. C.  having a process server deliver the summons and complaint to Riggins, the vice-president of PourPack. Riggins is not home when the process server knocks, so he leaves the papers with Riggins�s roomate, Schwartz. D.  delivering the summons and the complaint to Porado, a biochemist who is in charge of testing PourPack�s products for spoilage.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine the best method of service of process on PourPack Corporation, we need to examine each available option carefully according to the guidelines set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4.\n\n\nStep 2: Option A involves delivering the summons and complaint to Suares, a member of the board of directors of PourPack. According to Rule 4(h)(1)(B), service may be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation. Therefore, this would be a valid method of service.\n\n\nStep 3: Next, we look at Option B, which proposes delivering the papers to the Utah Secretary of State, based on a Utah statute that authorizes such service in actions against a corporation arising out of its activities in Utah and mailing a copy of the papers to PourPack's corporate address. Although some courts might argue that this does not comply with FRCP 4 since it relies on state law rather than being explicitly permitted by the rule, other courts could hold that it complies with the spirit of the rule allowing service upon agents appointed by law or designation. Thus, there is ambiguity here but still possible compliance depending on jurisdictional interpretation.\n\n\nStep 4: Moving forward to Option C, involving leaving the summons and complaint with Riggins' roommate, Schwartz, after attempting to serve Riggins, the vice-president of PourPack, is not acceptable. Physical delivery requires actual hand-to-hand transfer; merely leaving documents with someone else doesn't meet this requirement.\n\n\nStep 5: Lastly, examining Option D regarding delivering the summons and complaint to Porado, a biochemist responsible for product quality control, isn't specified anywhere within our given information as a suitable position for receiving official notices like those delivered via service of process.

            "Context": "Waiver of service. All of this is fairly technical, though important. But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by ��first-class mail or other reliable means.�� Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn�t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that�s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service. But it provides that the penalty for failure to waive is to pay the cost of formal service (Rule 4(d)(2)), clearly implying that if the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must serve her with a copy of the summons and complaint through one of the formal methods provided in Rule 4. So, consider these scenarios.",
            "Question": "8. Technical fouls.  Eban brings suit against Lorenzo for interference with business relations. Eban�s lawyer, Darrow, calls Lorenzo�s lawyer, Sadecki, and tells her that he is filing suit that afternoon. In which of the following scenarios may the case proceed without formal service of process?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Darrow files the complaint with the district court clerk with an affidavit swearing that he informed Sadecki of the case and mailed her a copy of the complaint. B.  Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by first class mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He files an affidavit with the court attesting to those acts. C.  Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by certified mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He does not send a summons, signed and sealed by the court, with the waiver request. He receives the signed waiver form back and files it with the court. D.  Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by certified mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He receives the green postal receipt back in the mail. Darrow files the postal receipt with the court. E.  In each of these scenarios, there is no proper waiver and formal service must be used.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the case proceeds without formal service of process, we need to examine the options presented and see which ones comply with the rules regarding waiver of service outlined in Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nStep 2: Option A involves Darrow informing Sadecki about the lawsuit over the phone and mailing a copy of the complaint along with an affidavit stating his actions. However, according to Rule 4(d)(1), a written request for waiver must be made, including specific details such as the name of the court where the suit was brought, a copy of the complaint, and instructions on how to respond. This makes Option A incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Moving on to Option B, Darrow sends a proper request for waiver via first-class mail to Lorenzo, accompanied by a copy of the complaint and an affidavit detailing his efforts. Since this meets all the criteria specified in Rule 4(d)(1), including sending the waiver request by'reliable means,' this scenario appears compliant with the federal rules governing waiver of service.\n\nStep 4: Next, let's evaluate Option C. Although Darrow sends the waiver request via certified mail, which could be considered a reliable means, he omits sending the summons signed and sealed by the court. According to Rule 4(c)(1), when using waiver of service, the summons must accompany the waiver request; otherwise, formal service would still be required. Therefore, Option C cannot stand.\n\nStep 5: Now examining Option D, even though Darrow uses certified mail and includes the waiver request, receiving the green postal receipt alone doesn't suffice as proof of delivery. As per Rule 4(d)(1), the defendant needs to sign and return the waiver form within the stipulated timeframe, making Option D also invalid.\n\nStep 6: Based on our evaluation above, only Option B correctly follows the procedures set forth in Rule 4(d) for requesting waiver of service.",

            "Context": "The basic federal venue provisions. Venue in most federal actions is governed by 28 U.S.C. �1391(b), which provides: (b) Venue in general. A civil action may be brought in� (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court�s personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. Note that subsections 1 and 2 are alternatives. Venue is proper in a district where  either  a defendant resides (if they are all residents of the state where the action is brought)  or  a district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. Section 1391(b)(3) is a ��fallback�� venue provision that is only available in unusual circumstances: when there is  no district , anywhere in the United States, where venue would be proper under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). If the defendants all reside in the state where suit is brought, or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in some federal judicial district, or if property that is the subject of the action is found in a district, �1391(b)(3) cannot apply, because there will be at least one district in which venue is proper under �1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Note also that there is a nasty proviso in 28 U.S.C. �1391(a) that poses a trap for the unwary: The first sentence of that subsection provides that the venue options in �1391(b) apply ��except as otherwise provided by law.�� Section 1391 is a general venue statute that applies unless  there is a special venue statute for the type of claim the plaintiff brings. The United States Code has many specialized venue provisions for particular types of actions. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. �1402 (tort action against the United States must be brought in the district where the plaintiff resides or wherein the act or omission complained of occurred). If there is a special venue statute for a particular type of claim, it may be interpreted as  displacing  the general venue choices in �1391(b)�that is, as providing alternative, exclusive venue choices for such claims�or as providing  additional  venue choices for those claims, along with those in �1391(b). See generally, Wright & Miller �3803. To sort out the basics of �1391(b), try the following question. Assume for all examples in the chapter that no special venue statute applies. In answering these questions, please  do refer to the venue statutes.  Once again, my questions are based on the assumption that you have the Federal Rules book available, so you can refer to relevant statutes and rules, rather than memorizing them. I want to test my students� ability to apply provisions like the venue statutes or Federal Rules, rather than their memory of them. Needless to say, you should find out  your professor�s  policy on bringing materials into the exam before you prepare for it.

Therefore, since not all defendants reside in the state of Indiana, venue is improper under §1391(b)(1).\n\nStep 2: Next we consider whether venue is proper under §1391(b)(2).\nNow let's analyze whether venue is proper under §1391(b)(2). This requires determining if a significant portion of the incidents leading up to the lawsuit happened in the chosen district. Here, the key event related to the dispute - the refusal to make further payments - allegedly occurred in the Western District of Tennessee during the negotiation process. However, the main issue arose in the Southern District of Ohio due to the location of the unfinished subdivision project. Thus, neither the primary site of the alleged wrongdoing nor its immediate aftermath falls squarely within the boundaries of the Southern District of Indiana. Consequently, venue is not properly laid according to §1391(b)(2).\n\n\nStep 3: Finally, we evaluate whether venue is proper under §1391(b)(3).\nSince venue isn't suitable under sections b(1) or b(2), we move onto examining whether venue could possibly fall under section b(3). According to this rule, if none of the other conditions meet, then venue might still exist somewhere else. Given our earlier findings about insufficient grounds for choosing districts under b(1) and b(2), we now explore potential jurisdictions fitting the description given in b(3): places where 'any defendant' is amenable to the court's authority regarding said case.",

            "updated_reasoning": ":\n\n\nStep 1: Let us reassess whether venue is proper under §1391(b)(1). For this purpose, we'll scrutinize each defendant's residence relative to the filing district. As per the information provided, Dziezek initiated the lawsuit against Torruella and Hopkins in the Southern District of Indiana. Upon reviewing their locations, we note that while Torruella resides in the Western District of Kentucky, Hopkins lives in the Western District of Tennessee. It seems reasonable to infer that Hopkins does not reside within the state of Indiana. Nonetheless, this observation merely underscores the necessity of verifying the residency status of every defendant participating in the litigation.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Now, let's proceed to investigate whether venue is suitable under §1391(b)(2). This entails identifying whether a considerable segment of occurrences preceding the lawsuit transpired within the selected district. Considering the situation presented here, the pivotal incident connected to the controversy – namely, the denial of future installments – supposedly unfolded in the Western District of Tennessee throughout the discussion phase. Meanwhile, the central problem emerged in the Southern District of Ohio owing to the placement of the incomplete subdivision development. Hence, neither the principal locus of the supposed misconduct nor its immediate consequences precisely fits inside the confines of the Southern District of Indiana. Subsequently, venue fails to comply with §1391(b)(2).\n\n\n\nStep 3: Lastly, we shall assess whether venue aligns with §1391(b)(3). Because venue wasn’t deemed acceptable under clauses b(1) or b(2), we shift focus towards exploring possible jurisdictions meeting the criteria specified in clause b(3): areas where ‘any defendant’ is susceptible to the court’s jurisdiction concerning the matter at hand.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "Venue in cases involving corporate defendants. The venue provisions in �1391(b) also apply in cases involving corporate defendants. Such cases may still be brought in a district in which all defendants reside, or where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. And subsection (3) is solely a fallback provision in cases involving corporate defendants, as in all other cases. But there is a confusing twist in cases involving corporate defendants. The twist arises from the definition of where a corporation ��resides�� for purposes of applying the venue provisions. Two subsections of �1391 deal with this. The first, 28 U.S.C. �1391(c)(2), provides that in cases where a corporation is the defendant, it shall be deemed to reside ��in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court�s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question. . . .�� The second, �1391(d), defines what district a corporation resides in if a state has more than one judicial district. It is even more perplexing: For purposes of venue under this chapter, in a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts. These two provisions are admittedly a little grim. Basically they provide (�1391(c)(2) for a single-district state and �1391(d) for a multi-district state) that a corporate defendant resides in any judicial district in which its contacts would support personal jurisdiction over it for the plaintiff�s claim. Why do we care where the corporation resides? Because �1391(b) allows venue in a district where all defendants reside. Section 1391(c) defines the residence of a corporate defendant  for purposes of applying �1391(b)(1). Let�s do an example; maybe it�ll help. Imagine that Sampson Corporation is incorporated in Delaware (a single-district state). Sampson has its principal place of business in Richmond, in the Eastern District of Virginia, but no other contacts in Virginia. Teller (a driver for Sampson, who lives in Delaware) has an accident with Rimini in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. What venues would be proper in Rimini�s action against Sampson Corporation for her injuries? Well, she could sue in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, basing venue on �1391(b)(2), right? Certainly the accident in that district is a substantial part of the events giving rise to her claim. But she could also choose to sue Sampson in any district in which it resides; �1391(b)(1) tells us that. And �1391(c)(2) tells us that Sampson resides in Delaware, since it could be sued in that district based on general in personam jurisdiction. See Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2853-2854 (2011) (place of incorporation a paradigm case for general in personam jurisdiction). And �1391(d) tells us that Sampson resides in the Eastern District of Virginia, since its principal place of business is there. See  id.  (citing principal place of business as another paradigm case for general in personam jurisdiction). So Sampson�s ��residences�� offer two additional venues for Rimini�s action. Just for contrast, suppose that Rimini sues Teller along with Sampson Corporation. The Eastern District of Pennsylvania is still a proper venue under �1391(b)(2). And the District of Delaware is also a proper venue under �1391(b)(1), because both defendants reside in Delaware: it is Teller�s domicile and Sampson resides there under �1391(c)(2). But the Eastern District of Virginia is not a proper venue under �1391(b)(1), because only one of the defendants resides there. Here�s a question that allows you to grapple with these confusing provisions in �1391.",

After he discovered that he was somewhat out of shape, he bought an exercise machine from Jackson, a friend from Kansas with a two-week time share in Aspen, who had brought the machine with him to Aspen after buying it in Texas. The machine was made by Sweda- Trak, a Texas company that sells its products only in Texas, and with its only place of business in the Western District of Texas. Chu brought the machine back to Los Angeles, California, where he was injured using it.

C.  proper in the Southern District of California under �1391(b)(2), because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place there. D.  improper in the Southern District of California, because, while a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place there, the defendants do not ��reside�� there under the venue statute.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's analyze each possible venue under the given options. Option A suggests that venue is proper in the Southern District of California under §1391(b)(2) because property that is the subject of the action is located there. However, this does not directly relate to the residency requirement mentioned in §1391(c).\n\nStep 2: Next, consider Option B, suggesting that venue is proper in the District of Colorado under §1391(b)(1) because both Jackson and Sweda-Trak reside there for venue purposes. To determine whether this is true, we need to examine their residences according to §1391(c).\n\nStep 3: According to §1391(c)(2), a corporation like Sweda-Trak shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question. Since Sweda-Trak is incorporated in Texas and has its sole place of business in the Western District of Texas, it likely resides in that district due to being subject to general in-personam jurisdiction there.\n\nStep 4: Now, looking at Jackson, his situation is different. He is an individual residing in Kansas, but he owns a home in Aspen, Colorado, during certain periods. This might suggest some connection to Colorado, but without further information about how often he spends time in Colorado versus Kansas, it's difficult to say definitively where he “resides” for venue purposes.\n\nStep 5: Given the above considerations, neither party seems to have strong ties to the District of Colorado beyond perhaps occasional visits or ownership interests. Therefore, it appears unlikely that both parties would meet the criteria for residing in the same district for venue purposes under §1391(b)(1).\n\n\nStep 6: Moving forward, let's evaluate Option C, proposing that venue is proper in the Southern District of California under §1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there. While it is indeed true that a portion of the incident happened when Chu used the machine in Los Angeles, this alone doesn't necessarily make the entire district suitable for venue.\n\n\nStep 7: Finally, examining Option D, stating that venue is improper in the Southern District of California because, although a substantial part of the events leading up to the lawsuit transpired there, the defendants don’t ‘‘reside’’ there under the venue law. Based on our earlier discussion regarding the meaning of residency under §1391(c), particularly concerning corporations and individuals, this statement holds merit.",

            "Context": "Forum non conveniens and transfer. So, venue is the ��third ring�� in choosing a proper court, along with personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction. If all three rings are satisfied, the court has the power to hear the case. However, it doesn�t always do so. Sometimes a case is filed in a court that has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and is a proper venue under the venue statutes, yet the court concludes, as a matter of common sense, that it should be litigated somewhere else. Suppose, for example, that Robinson, driving through Oklahoma on her way to her new home in Arizona, has an accident in Oklahoma driving a Mervin automobile, made by Mervin Motors in Ohio. Robinson wants to sue Mervin, a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in the Western District of Texas, for her injuries. She contacts a lawyer in Texas, who files suit on her behalf in federal court in the Western District of Texas against Mervin. That court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case (based on diversity) and personal jurisdiction over Mervin (general in personam jurisdiction, as approved in  Daimler , based on its principal place of business in Texas). It is also a proper venue: Mervin ��resides�� in the Western District of Texas under �1391(b)(1) and (d). So Robinson has jumped through all the hoops, and the court has the authority to hear her case. But it doesn�t make a lot of sense for it to do so, since the events took place in Ohio, where the car was made, and Oklahoma, where it allegedly caused the accident. Why Texas for this case? In  Gilbert v. Gulf Oil Co. , 330 U.S. 501 (1947), the Supreme Court held that a federal district court could ��dismiss for forum non conveniens�� in cases like this, on the ground that, even though it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the case, practical factors suggest that it should be litigated somewhere else. The  Gulf Oil  court noted a number of factors a judge should consider in deciding whether to dismiss for forum non conveniens. One set of factors, the so-called ��private interest factors,�� relate to the convenience of litigating the case. Such factors include the location of the events giving rise to the case, the ability to implead other parties in the court, the ability to take a view of premises involved in the dispute, and the location of relevant witnesses and documentary evidence.  Gulf Oil  also noted several ��public interest�� factors, including (among others) whether the dispute involves local people or events, and is likely to be decided under local law. In the Robinson example, both the private interest factors and the public interest factors point to litigating elsewhere�probably Oklahoma� rather than in Texas, since the events took place in Ohio and Oklahoma, evidence is likely to be in those places, Oklahoma law is likely to govern, and Oklahomans�not Texans�would likely have an interest in observing the litigation and taking part (as jurors) in deciding it. In response to the  Gulf Oil  decision, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. �1404(a), the federal transfer-of-venue statute. Under this section, a judge may  transfer  a case filed in her court that should be litigated elsewhere to the more appropriate federal district, instead of dismissing it for forum non conveniens. (a) For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented. This statute makes good administrative sense. Because the federal district courts are all units of the same system, Congress has the authority to provide for transfer of cases among them to promote efficiency. 1  And, because the case is transferred rather than dismissed, the plaintiff need not file a new complaint, serve the defendant with process again or face statute of limitations problems. The case is simply passed on to the more appropriate federal district, where the litigation continues. Although the standard for transfer (��for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice��) is as broad as a barn, case law interpreting �1404(a) makes clear that the factors outlined in  Gulf Oil continue to govern the trial judge�s discretionary decision whether to transfer a case to another district. However, since the consequences of transfer are less drastic, the presumption in favor of the plaintiff�s chosen forum is somewhat weaker under �1404(a) than it would be under the common law forum non conveniens principle. Today, �1404(a), rather than the common law forum non conveniens doctrine, governs most cases that are brought in a federal court. If the case should be litigated in another district, (and if it ��might have been brought�� in that district), the federal court will transfer it to that district under �1404(a) rather than dismiss for forum non conveniens. However, if the proper forum under the  Gulf Oil  analysis is in  another country,  the transfer statute does not apply; Congress could not enact a statute requiring courts in another country to accept transferred cases. Thus dismissal for forum non conveniens is the court�s only option in cases like  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno , 454 U.S. 235 (1981), in which the court concluded that the case should be heard in Scotland. Forum non conveniens is also applied in state courts, which have no power to transfer cases to the courts of another state. If Jones files a case in a North Dakota state court that really ought to be litigated in Wisconsin, the North Dakota court will dismiss for forum non conveniens, leaving Jones to pursue his remedy by filing a new action in Wisconsin. Note that �1404(a) allows transfer of a case to a district ��where it might have been brought.�� The Supreme Court has interpreted this phrase to mean that the case can only be transferred to a district where it could have been filed originally, that is, one that would be a proper venue and where the defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction for the claim. 2   Hoffman v. Blaski,  363 U.S. 335 (1960). This substantially limits the court�s options. For example, in  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286 (1980), Oklahoma would certainly be an appropriate place of trial for the plaintiff�s claim against Seaway, the New York dealership that sold the car.

Ace has an office in the Northern District of Texas, but no other offices in Texas. It has large operations in three other states. Connors negotiated the contract by phone and e-mail from his home, dealing with Ace employees in the Texas office and the Illinois office. He did the programming work, which was to be used for Ace�s Texas operation, at his home. Ace Corporation claimed that Connors had only done half the work, and refused to pay. Connors, believing that he had completed all the work called for under the contract, brought a diversity action against Ace for the contract price ($200,000) in federal court in the Northern District of Texas.",

            "Context": "Complications, complications: Transfer under 28 U.S.C. �1406(a). So, when a plaintiff files suit in a district that is proper under the venue statute, the court may hear the case. However, it might also transfer it if the  Gulf Oil  factors suggest that it should be litigated in another federal district. But suppose a plaintiff files in a district that is  not  a proper venue under 28 U.S.C. �1391? Naturally, the defendant may move to dismiss such a case for improper venue, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). And, the court would be within its rights to grant the motion. But could it  transfer  the case instead, to a federal district in which venue is proper? This is the scenario addressed by 28 U.S.C. �1406(a). Section 1404(a) applies to cases in which the plaintiff chooses a proper venue and the court considers transferring the case elsewhere. Section 1406(a) applies when the plaintiff files in an improper venue and the court considers curing the problem by transfer. Section 1406(a) provides that, if the case is filed in an improper venue, the court ��shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.�� Note several things about the statute: first, it gives the federal district judge the authority to dismiss rather than transfer. Second, it allows the judge to transfer, even though the case is not properly before her (because venue is improper). And third, it limits the districts the case can be transferred to: It may only be moved to a district where it might have been brought. The cases interpret this limitation in �1406(a) the same as the similar language in �1404(a), that is, to limit transfer to a district that would be a proper venue and have personal jurisdiction over the defendants. A striking virtue of section 1406(a) is that it allows a court to save a plaintiff�s cause of action if she files in the wrong venue shortly before the limitations period passes. Section 1404(a) would not authorize transfer: It applies to cases that are properly filed in the transferor district. But �1406(a) allows the court to transfer the case to a proper district rather than dismissing. Thus, the suit is not re-started in the transferee forum, but continued. As long as it was filed in the wrong venue before the limitations period ran, the judge can send it to a district that is proper under the venue statute, and it will continue on, even though it only reached the proper court after the passage of the limitations period. It also saves the plaintiff the trouble of drafting a new complaint, refiling it in the new district, and reserving the defendants with process. Here�s an illustration.",

To determine whether transfer is possible, we look at 28 U.S.C.�1406(a), which states that if a case is filed in an improper venue, the court shall either dismiss the case or, if it serves the interests of justice, transfer the case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\n\nStep 4: We examine the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C.�1406(a): the court must identify a district where the case could have originally been brought; i.e., a district having both personal jurisdiction over all parties and proper venue under 28 U.S.C.�1391.\n\nStep 5: Given these considerations, let us analyze each option presented.\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "The bad old days: The rule of  Swift v. Tyson. The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789. They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. �1652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law  would  apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress�s intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as ��the RDA��) more narrowly in  Swift.  Justice Story concluded that the phrase, ��the laws of the several states�� in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that ��The only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,��  Swift  recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state ��law�� in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct,  Swift  concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court�even in Pennsylvania�to follow that decision. If it didn�t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply  the common law  to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn�t think of it as ��Pennsylvania common law,�� or ��Georgia common law,�� but as  the common law,  which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue�such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser�and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the ��true rule�� of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities. 1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in  Swift  that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the  Swift  case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, ��What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,�� but rather, ��what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?�� So, under  Swift,  federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat.

If it didn�t apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply  the common law  to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn�t think of it as ��Pennsylvania common law,�� or ��Georgia common law,�� but as  the common law,  which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue�such as the duty of care owed to a trespasser�and determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the ��true rule�� of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities. 1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in  Swift  that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the  Swift  case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, ��What is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,�� but rather, ��what is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?�� So, under  Swift,  federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat. Assume that pre- Erie  law, that is, the  Swift  doctrine, applies.\nThe case usually given as a perfectly horrible example of the application of Swift is Black& White Taxicab Co. v. Brown& Yellow Taxicab Co.,  276 U.S. 518 (1928). In that case, Brown & Yellow ran a taxi business in Kentucky, but reincorporated in Tennessee, to create diversity between it and Black & White Taxicab Company. It then brought a diversity action in federal court�in Kentucky�to enforce its exclusive contract with the railroad for conveyance of passengers at the Bowling Green, Kentucky, railroad station. Federal courts, under Swift, enforced such exclusive contracts, but Kentucky�s courts did not. Brown & Yellow, having manipulated the case into federal court, argued that the federal court could enforce the contract. Consider this variation on the Black & White case.",
            "Question": "2. The out-of-state advantage.  In 1920, before  Erie , Black & White Taxicab, incorporated and doing all its business in Kentucky, sought to do business at the Bowling Green railroad station. However, Brown & Yellow Taxicab, a Tennessee cab company, had an exclusive contract with the railroad to pick up and discharge passengers there. Since Kentucky courts held such contracts against public policy, Black & White sued Brown & Yellow in a Kentucky court, to enjoin it from enforcing the contract. Brown & Yellow removed the case to federal court in Kentucky (the only court it could remove to�see now 28 U.S.C. �1441(a)) on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.

However, the key point here is whether the fact that the original lawsuit was filed in a Kentucky court affects our interpretation of the applicable law.\n\nStep 3: Considering the specific circumstances of the Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co. case, we see that the dispute revolves around an exclusive contract between two companies operating in different states. \n\nStep 4: As per the Swift ruling, when determining the appropriate common law principle to apply, federal courts consider relevant authorities across various jurisdictions, including secondary materials like treatises.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, applying the logic from Swift, the federal court's task involves identifying the most suitable common law standard regarding exclusive contracts, taking into account precedents from multiple jurisdictions.",

In  Erie,  the Supreme Court held that  Swift �s interpretation of the RDA, restricting its scope to state statutes and local usages, led to an unconstitutional assumption of power by the federal courts. Under the Constitution, the federal government is a government of limited powers. It can legislate on those subjects delegated to it in Article I of the Constitution, but power to legislate on subjects  not  within that delegation is left to the states.

Congress has no general power to make law in areas such as contracts, torts, commercial law, and wills and trusts. But under  Swift  the federal courts  were  making law in these areas in diversity cases. It was this undelegated assumption of law-making power that the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional in  Erie.  Instead, the  Erie  Court held, the RDA must be interpreted to require federal courts to apply not only the state statutes, but also the common law of the state in a diversity case. Under  Erie,  the federal court in a diversity case cannot apply federal law, or its own perception of the ��proper�� rule under ��general common law.�� Instead, it must apply the law of the relevant state, whether that law is found in a state statute or established by the state�s courts through case law. If Pennsylvania has a statute proclaiming that trespassers are owed only a duty to avoid willful and wanton negligence, a federal court sitting in diversity must apply that statute (if the appropriate state law is Pennsylvania law). If there is no relevant statute, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that trespassers are owed a duty to avoid willful and wanton negligence, a federal diversity court must apply that judicial rule. A federal diversity court, after  Erie,  is not a law-making court. It is instead a law-applying court, and the law it applies is the law of the relevant state.

In his first claim for relief, he alleges that Beta violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, by firing him due to his age.

(The federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over this claim, because it arises out of the same events as the federal claim.)

            "Context": "Federal courts determining the content of state law. The  Erie  case established the basic proposition: A federal court hearing a state law claim�whether in a diversity case or a federal question case with supplemental state law claims�must apply the law of the relevant state to the state law claim, not make ��general common law.�� That, of course, provides a fresh problem for the federal judge in such cases: how is she to determine what the law of the state  is ? Sometimes this is easy. If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has recently decided a case on the duty of care to a trespasser on a railroad right of way, and reaffirmed the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge knows her course. But how often will that be true? More often, there will be an older state supreme court decision on point, or on an analogous point. Perhaps there�s a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case from 1963 that reaffirms the willful/ wanton rule for railroad trespassers, or a 1982 case that  abandons  that rule for trespassers on residential property . . . or both! Or, perhaps there is dicta in a 1998 Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court opinion suggesting that the early case establishing the willful/wanton rule is inconsistent with modern tort principles of the state, including the 1982 case on residential trespassers. Suppose that all three of these cases are on the books, the 1963 decision reiterating the willful/wanton rule, the 1982 state supreme court decision changing the rule for residential property, and the 1998 appellate court decision doubting whether the willful/wanton rule would be followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court today. What should the federal court do? Early post- Erie  cases suggested that the federal court had to follow any state precedent on point, whether the state supreme court would be likely to decide differently today. Under this approach, the federal court, sitting in diversity and adjudicating a railroad trespasser case, would have to apply the 1963 case affirming the willful/wanton rule. That case is on point, and has not been overruled. Thus, it is ��good law,�� even if it might�or even probably�would be reconsidered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court if the issue reached that court today. The Supreme Court�s early decisions suggested that the same would be true if the only case on point were from an intermediate appellate court, or even from a trial court. See  West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co.,  311 U.S. 223 (1940); Fidelity Trust Co. v. Field,  311 U.S. 169 (1940). This approach, however, is unnecessarily rigid. Under it, the federal judge would have to apply a rule even though she is firmly convinced that it would not be applied in the state court system, if the case got up to the state supreme court. Later, the Supreme Court recognized this and provided a more flexible approach for federal judges applying state law. Under this approach, the federal judge is to apply the state law as she concludes that it would be applied today by the supreme court of the relevant state. Under this ��supreme court predictive�� approach, the federal judge has more latitude to conclude, even though older precedents are still on the books, that they would be swept away if the issue reached the state supreme court again. If she is firmly convinced, for example, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would overrule the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge could refuse to apply it, even though that 1963 case is still, as a matter of precedent, ��good law.�� The federal judge would not lightly make the prediction that a state supreme court case would be overruled, however, since this would lead to application of a rule in federal court that is not yet�and perhaps never will be�the law of the state. See, e.g.,  Carleton v. Worcester Ins. Co., 923 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (warning that litigants should not expect that new [state law] trails will frequently be blazed in diversity cases). This question considers the dilemma of a post- Erie  judge trying conscientiously to fulfill her law-applying role.",
            "Question": "5. Predicting the present.  Laurel and Hardy are both injured in an accident in the State of Emporia, when their car is involved in an accident with Fields�s and Connors�s cars. Laurel sues Fields for his injuries in state court. Hardy sues Fields for his injuries in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Laurel alleges, in the state suit, that Fields is jointly and severally liable for all of his damages, even if Connors was partly at fault as well. Fields argues, however, that he is only ��severally�� liable for his percentage of fault, that is, that if the jury finds he was 40 percent at fault, and Connors 60 percent, he should only be liable for 40 percent of Laurel�s damages, instead of 100 percent. In the federal suit, Hardy alleges that Fields is jointly and severally liable for his full damages, and Fields raises the same defense, that under Emporia law he is only liable for his own percentage of fault. Both suits are filed in 2012. The state of Emporia law is as follows. The Emporia Supreme Court held, in 1911, in  Powers v. Hall, that tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a plaintiff�s full damages, even if another actor was also at fault in causing the injury. Over the years, the rule has been applied numerous times. In 1998, in Sholto v. Dickens,  the Emporia Supreme Court refused to change to several liability, but there was a vigorous dissent from two justices (out of the seven on the court). Since then, one of the judges who was in the majority in  Sholto  has left the bench and been replaced. Also, a neighboring state switched to several liability in 2000. Assume further that in 1995, a draft of the Third Restatement of Torts, promulgated by the prestigious American Law Institute, endorsed several liability as the appropriate rule. In 2001, it issued the final draft of the Third Restatement, which also favors several liability rather than joint and several liability. In Laurel and Hardy�s cases",
            "Options": "Options: A.  both the federal and state judges will probably rule that joint and several liability applies. B.  the state judge will probably rule that joint and several liability applies, but the federal judge will probably rule that several liability applies. C.  the state judge will probably rule that several liability applies, but the federal judge will probably rule that joint and several liability applies. D.  both judges will probably rule that several liability applies.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand the current state of Emporia law regarding joint and several liability. According to the given information, the Emporia Supreme Court held in 1911 that tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a plaintiff's full damages, even if another actor was also at fault in causing the injury. This ruling has been consistently applied over the years.\n\nStep 2: However, there are some indications that the Emporia Supreme Court may consider revisiting its stance on joint and several liability. In 1998, the court declined to switch to several liability in Sholto v. Dickens, but there was a strong dissent from two justices. Additionally, one of the judges who voted against switching to several liability has since retired and been replaced.\n\nStep 3: Furthermore, changes in other jurisdictions' laws and influential publications like the Third Restatement of Torts suggest that the tide may be turning towards several liability. Nevertheless, until the Emporia Supreme Court explicitly adopts a different standard, lower courts within the state are bound to follow existing precedent.\n\nStep 4: Given the above considerations, we now turn our attention to the roles of the state and federal judges in Laurel and Hardy's respective lawsuits. As a general principle, federal judges exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive law of the forum state, just as state judges would. Therefore, unless the Emporia Supreme Court itself indicates otherwise through subsequent rulings, the state judge in Laurel's lawsuit will most likely adhere to the long-standing doctrine of joint and several liability.\n\nStep 5: On the other hand, the federal judge presiding over Hardy's case faces no similar constraints. While the federal judge cannot unilaterally impose novel interpretations of Emporia law, she does possess discretion to predict how the Emporia Supreme Court would resolve the issue if faced with it directly. Considering the evolving landscape surrounding joint and several liability, along with the potential influence of external factors like the Third Restatement of Torts, the federal judge may reasonably anticipate that the Emporia Supreme Court would eventually adopt a more nuanced approach favoring several liability.",

In 1942, after  Erie Railroad v. Tompkins  was decided, Blue & Green Taxicab Company starts picking up passengers at the station, arguing that Red & Orange�s contract is unenforceable because such exclusive contracts are against public policy. Red & Orange brings a diversity action in federal court, seeking to enjoin Blue & Green from using the station grounds. The federal judge, under  Erie , is bound to apply Tennessee law, but assume that Tennessee has never decided the issue. The federal district judge concludes, after reviewing Tennessee cases in related areas, that Tennessee would hold such exclusive contracts enforceable. She therefore grants the injunction, barring Blue & Green from interfering with the contract. This decision is affirmed by the federal Court of Appeals.

            "Context": "Federal courts determining the content of state law. The  Erie  case established the basic proposition: A federal court hearing a state law claim�whether in a diversity case or a federal question case with supplemental state law claims�must apply the law of the relevant state to the state law claim, not make ��general common law.�� That, of course, provides a fresh problem for the federal judge in such cases: how is she to determine what the law of the state  is ? Sometimes this is easy. If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has recently decided a case on the duty of care to a trespasser on a railroad right of way, and reaffirmed the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge knows her course. But how often will that be true? More often, there will be an older state supreme court decision on point, or on an analogous point. Perhaps there�s a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case from 1963 that reaffirms the willful/ wanton rule for railroad trespassers, or a 1982 case that  abandons  that rule for trespassers on residential property . . . or both! Or, perhaps there is dicta in a 1998 Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court opinion suggesting that the early case establishing the willful/wanton rule is inconsistent with modern tort principles of the state, including the 1982 case on residential trespassers. Suppose that all three of these cases are on the books, the 1963 decision reiterating the willful/wanton rule, the 1982 state supreme court decision changing the rule for residential property, and the 1998 appellate court decision doubting whether the willful/wanton rule would be followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court today. What should the federal court do? Early post- Erie  cases suggested that the federal court had to follow any state precedent on point, whether the state supreme court would be likely to decide differently today. Under this approach, the federal court, sitting in diversity and adjudicating a railroad trespasser case, would have to apply the 1963 case affirming the willful/wanton rule. That case is on point, and has not been overruled. Thus, it is ��good law,�� even if it might�or even probably�would be reconsidered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court if the issue reached that court today. The Supreme Court�s early decisions suggested that the same would be true if the only case on point were from an intermediate appellate court, or even from a trial court. See  West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co.,  311 U.S. 223 (1940); Fidelity Trust Co. v. Field,  311 U.S. 169 (1940). This approach, however, is unnecessarily rigid. Under it, the federal judge would have to apply a rule even though she is firmly convinced that it would not be applied in the state court system, if the case got up to the state supreme court. Later, the Supreme Court recognized this and provided a more flexible approach for federal judges applying state law. Under this approach, the federal judge is to apply the state law as she concludes that it would be applied today by the supreme court of the relevant state. Under this ��supreme court predictive�� approach, the federal judge has more latitude to conclude, even though older precedents are still on the books, that they would be swept away if the issue reached the state supreme court again. If she is firmly convinced, for example, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would overrule the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge could refuse to apply it, even though that 1963 case is still, as a matter of precedent, ��good law.�� The federal judge would not lightly make the prediction that a state supreme court case would be overruled, however, since this would lead to application of a rule in federal court that is not yet�and perhaps never will be�the law of the state. See, e.g.,  Carleton v. Worcester Ins. Co., 923 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (warning that litigants should not expect that new [state law] trails will frequently be blazed in diversity cases). The impact of change in the state law on federal diversity cases State law is not static. It may change while a federal diversity case is being litigated, before it is litigated, after it is litigated, or while it is on appeal. If it changes during the litigation, should the federal court conform to the state law as it existed when the case arose, when it was filed, when it was tried, or as of some other point in the litigation? Here�s a question that illustrates the problem. The basic premises of Erie  should help you to choose the best answer.",
            "Question": "7. Comedy of errors.  Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields�s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff�s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy�s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant�s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields�s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields�s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court�s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability. Gleason, the other defendant, moves for relief from the judgment against him in the federal district court, on the ground that the judgment was based on a mistake concerning the applicable law.

The federal district court will grant Gleason�s motion for relief from judgment. C.  reverse the decision in Fields�s case, and remand it for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The federal district court will probably deny Gleason�s motion for relief from judgment. D.  None of the above is accurate.",

            "Context": "Which state�s law? The message of the  Erie  case is clear: ��federal court: apply state law in a diversity case.�� But there was an interesting twist in  Erie  that the Supreme Court didn�t discuss. Tompkins�s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York.  Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which  state�s law, Pennsylvania�s�where the accident happened�or New York�s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has ��choice-of-law�� rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the ��lex loci delicti�� choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After  Erie  established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing  which  state�s law to use in a case like  Erie.  Should federal courts develop their own ��choice-of-law�� rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after  Erie , the Supreme Court addressed this issue in  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co.,  313 U.S. 487 (1941).  Klaxon  held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins�s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins�s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon  reasoned that  Erie  required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts  of the state where the federal court sat.  To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When  Erie  was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti  choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the  lex loci  rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins�s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law�or that of a third state�to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under  Klaxon , that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York�s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under  Klaxon ), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins�s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins�s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law , since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The  Klaxon  Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the  Erie  analysis.",

            "Context": "Guaranty Trust Co. v. York: First efforts at drawing a line. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, decided seven years after Erie, considered whether a federal court had to apply a state statute of limitations in a diversity case, instead of the ��laches�� doctrine previously applied by federal courts in equity cases. Certainly, the question of what limitations period to apply to a case is a step closer to ��procedure�� than the duty-to a-trespasser issue in Erie. It involves the issue of how long a party has to file suit, which relates to the litigation process, rather than the duty owed between parties outside of litigation. It was not at all clear that Erie meant that the Rules of Decision Act required a diversity court to apply such procedural rules in diversity cases. In Guaranty, the Court refused to resolve the issue by labeling a limitations period as ��substantive�� or ��procedural.�� Instead, the Court looked to the underlying policy Erie sought to achieve, that the choice of state or federal court in a diversity case should not affect the outcome of the case. The intent of that decision [Erie] was to insure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court. 326 U.S. at 109. Under this rationale, if federal practice differs from state practice, the court should determine whether the case would come out differently if it applied its own rule. If it would, a federal diversity court should use the state rule instead. Since York�s case might go forward if the federal court applied the federal laches doctrine, but was barred under the state limitations period, York held that the federal court should apply the state limitations period. Thus, York established an ��outcome-determinative test�� for determining the reach of the Rules of Decision Act.

            "Context": "Byrd v. Blue Ridge: A caveat based on countervailing federal policies. Fundamentally, Erie was a constitutional decision, based on the premise that areas of law not delegated to the federal government remained with the states. The Erie Court rejected the idea that federal courts could ��make up�� the law of contracts, torts or property simply because they had jurisdiction to hear diversity cases. But York mandated deference to state law even in areas where there was constitutional authority to make a separate federal rule. This was a big step, taken without much discussion of its implications by Justice Frankfurter in York. For example, Article III, �2 of the Constitution, together with the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, �8), provide constitutional authority for federal courts to apply their own rules on matters of procedure, like the method of service of process. A federal court would hardly be a court if it couldn�t organize itself (or be organized by Congress) and provide basic procedures for the conduct of judicial business. Yet Justice Frankfurter�s outcome-determinative test required deference to state law even in such matters of litigation procedure. This broadened considerably the area in which federal courts deferred to state law. Erie had not suggested that such deference to state law would be required in procedural matters. York, in other words, expanded Erie from a constitutional doctrine, under which federal courts applied state law in diversity cases because there was no other constitutional possibility, to a broader doctrine based on the policy of promoting uniform outcomes in diversity cases in the two court systems. Since the purpose of diversity jurisdiction was merely to provide an alternative, presumably neutral forum, it should provide just that, a different forum that applied the same rules. That way, diverse plaintiffs would obtain no litigation advantage by virtue of their right to choose a federal court, only an unbiased forum applying the same law. This difference between deferring to state law for constitutional reasons and doing so for policy reasons, is important in understanding Byrd v. Blue Ridge. Where deference to state law is constitutionally mandated, it is not ��balanced�� against other policies. The court applies state law because ��there can be no other law.�� Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 472. But where the federal court could, constitutionally, apply its own rule, and is making a discretionary policy decision whether to apply state law to ensure uniform outcomes, the court may balance that uniformity policy against other policies. Sometimes, those other policies may be sufficiently strong to outweigh York�s emphasis on uniform state/federal outcomes in diversity cases. That is the basic holding of Byrd. While Byrd is sometimes thought of as breaking with the York analysis, Byrd actually reaffirms both Erie and York. In Byrd, Justice Brennan reaffirmed that diversity courts must ��respect the definition of state-created rights and obligations,�� as well as state rules ��bound up with rights and obligations of the parties.�� This restates the core constitutional holding of Erie, that the federal court must apply state law governing primary rights, because it has no constitutional power to substitute its own rules, as the Court had done under Swift v. Tyson. Justice Brennan then noted that the cases following Erie�notably York�had ��evinced a broader policy�� of conforming to state law where failure to do so might lead to a different result in federal court. In other words, York mandated deference to state law, as a matter of policy, even where such deference was not required by the Constitution. Thus, diversity courts had applied state rules ��even of form and mode�� (that is, matters having to do with procedure in conducting the litigation, rather than primary rights like the duty of care owed to a trespasser) under the outcome-determinative test, although they would have constitutional authority to follow a separate federal practice. For example, on the facts of Question 1, a federal court would presumably follow the state service rule under York, although this is not a substantive matter as to which it is constitutionally bound to follow state law. Byrd expressed no general dissent from this outcome determinative test, even in matters of ��form and mode.�� However, Justice Brennan suggested that in matters of litigation procedure, where state practice is followed as a policy choice rather than as a constitutional imperative, the York policy of uniform outcomes should be considered along with other policies, which might sometimes outweigh the uniformity policy. In Byrd itself, the division of functions between the judge and jury in federal cases, under the ��influence�� of the Seventh Amendment, was an important consideration supporting the use of federal procedure in federal court. Since the state law was not ��bound up with rights and obligations of the parties�� (in which case the federal court would have to defer to it), the Court could consider ��affirmative countervailing considerations.�� In Byrd, the federal priority given to the role of the jury outweighed the policy in favor of uniform state/ federal outcomes in diversity cases. So Byrd did not overrule York�s deferential approach in diversity cases or question its central premise. Rather, it noted that in cases involving procedural differences between state and federal law, this policy-based deference could be outweighed by important policies concerning the integrity of the federal court system. Such balancing would only be appropriate, however, for matters of ��form and mode,�� issues of court procedure in processing cases, not for matters closely related to substantive rights. As to matters bound up with substantive rights, Erie and York continued to mandate use of state law. Transport yourself back to 1960 and consider how the following case would be analyzed shortly after Byrd was decided.",

The statute authorizes plaintiffs who prevail on their claims to recover attorneys� fees in litigating the case as well. The purpose of the fees statute is to promote enforcement of consumers� rights by encouraging aggrieved parties (and their lawyers) to sue. Awarding fees to prevailing plaintiffs significantly increases recoveries, since they must otherwise pay their lawyers out of their damage awards. Assume that there is no provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for prevailing plaintiffs to recover their attorneys� fees, nor do federal judges allow them as a matter of judicial practice.

            "Context": "Second track:  Hanna v. Plumer That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer.  But  Hanna  changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule.  York  and  Byrd  both involved such conflicts.  York  involved a conflict between a state statute and the  judicial practice  of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And  Byrd  involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal  judicial practice  of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these ��relatively unguided��  Erie  conflicts,  Hanna  reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in  Byrd�s  language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because ��there can be no other law.��  Hanna , 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury�s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy  Erie  sought to further�uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts�but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the  Hanna  opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of  York �s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are  not  prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and ��inequitable administration of the laws,�� that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York  line of cases would  not  require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following  Question 1 .) That�s  Hanna  Part I. It�s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in  Hanna , unlike in  York  or in  Byrd , the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. �2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna  construed Congress�s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is ��rationally capable of classification�� as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the ��outcome-determinative�� test of  York,  or the more refined outcome-determinative test of  Hanna  Part I. But the rule involved in  Hanna  wasn�t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to ��prescribe general rules of practice and procedure�� for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. �2072(a). In  Hanna , the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress�s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren interpreted �2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that ��really regulates procedure,�the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.�� 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from  Sibbach v. Wilson & Co ., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress�s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress�s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court�s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. �2072(b) provides that the Rules ��shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.�� Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. �2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, �2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under �2072(b). In  Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the  Sibbach  test, and�even if it is�it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after  Hanna  is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the ��modified outcome-determinative test�� of Hanna  Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under  Hanna  Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the ��Supreme Law of the Land.�� United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help.

York  and  Byrd  both involved such conflicts.  York  involved a conflict between a state statute and the  judicial practice  of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And  Byrd  involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal  judicial practice  of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these ��relatively unguided��  Erie  conflicts,  Hanna  reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in  Byrd�s  language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because ��there can be no other law.��  Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury�s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy  Erie  sought to further–uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts-but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the  Hanna  opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of  York ‘s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are  not  prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and ��inequitable administration of the laws,�� that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last-and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York  line of cases would  not  require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following  Question 1.) That’s  Hanna  Part I. It’s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in  Hanna, unlike in  York  or in  Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. �2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna  construed Congress’s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is ��rationally capable of classification�� as procedural... even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the ��outcome-determinative�� test of  York,  or the more refined outcome-determinative test of  Hanna  Part I. But the rule involved in  Hanna  wasn’t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to ��prescribe general rules of practice and procedure�� for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. �2072(a). In  Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress’s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of  Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted �2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that ��really regulates procedure,the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.�� 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from  Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress’s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress’s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court’s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. �2072(b) provides that the Rules ��shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.�� Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. �2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, �2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under �2072(b).

            "Context": "C. Second track:  Hanna v. Plumer That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer.  But  Hanna  changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule.  York  and  Byrd  both involved such conflicts.  York  involved a conflict between a state statute and the  judicial practice  of applying the equitable laches doctrine.

When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under �2072(b). In  Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the  Sibbach  test, and�even if it is�it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after  Hanna  is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the ��modified outcome-determinative test�� of Hanna  Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under  Hanna  Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the ��Supreme Law of the Land.�� United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help.

            "Context": "Direct conflicts with the Federal Rules. After Hanna , a crucial first step in solving  Erie  problems is determining whether the case involves a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and state practice, or a ��relatively unguided�� conflict between federal judicial practice and state practice. One would think this fairly straightforward, but the Supreme Court hasn�t found it easy to decide when a Federal Rule directly conflicts with state practice. For example, in  Walker v. Armco Steel Corp ., 446 U.S. 740 (1980), state practice provided that the plaintiff must file suit within the limitations period and serve process in the action on the defendant within sixty days, to avoid being barred. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, however, an action is ��commenced by filing a complaint with the court.�� If Rule 3 provides that filing the complaint satisfies the limitations period, an action (like the one in  Walker ) might be barred under state law�because service of process was not made in time�but timely under the Federal Rule (because the complaint was filed within the limitations period). In  Walker,  the Court avoided the problem by holding that Federal Rule 3 did not address the issue of meeting the limitations period. Instead, the Court held that Rule 3 establishes the date for computing various time limits under the Rules�such as the time to answer the complaint�but ��does not affect state statutes of limitations.�� Id. at 751. Thus, the conflict was a  Hanna  Part I conflict, since there was no ��direct collision�� between the Federal Rule and the state statute. Consequently, the  Walker  Court looked to the modified outcome-determination analysis of Hanna  Part I, and concluded that the state limitations statute should apply, since the case otherwise could go forward in federal court but would be barred in state court. Since  Walker , several other Supreme Court cases have narrowly construed Federal Rules to avoid a ��direct collision�� ( Walker  at 749) with state law. See, e.g.,  Semtek International Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp ., 531 U.S. 497, 502-505, 1024-1027 (2001). Others, however, have found a direct conflict where a narrower reading seemed possible. In Burlington Northern R.R. Co. v. Woods , 480 U.S. 1 (1987), for example, the Court concluded that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, which allows but does not require an award of fees to a prevailing appellant, conflicted with an Alabama statute that imposed a mandatory penalty for unsuccessful appeals. Id. at 6-8. Since it found a direct conflict, the Court held that Federal Rule 38 would apply, despite the contrary Alabama provision. This question, whether there is a conflict between a Federal Rule and state procedural provision, is basically one of statutory construction. There�s a lot of play here, and not too much help to be offered in predicting whether the court will find an irreconcilable conflict between the state rule and the Federal Rule. It seems likely, however, that where a logical limiting construction is possible that avoids a direct conflict, the court will lean towards that construction. Try this example for some ��direct collision�� practice.",
            "Question": "5. Part I or Part II?  Assume that Rule 4(q) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a civil action in federal court is commenced, for purposes of satisfying the relevant statute of limitations, upon filing of the complaint with the clerk�s office. However, cases in the state of Emporia have held that the limitations period is only satisfied if the complaint is actually served on the defendant within the statutory period.

D.  apply the state approach, because there is no ��direct conflict�� between the two rules.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine how to proceed with the case involving Tubby's lawsuit against Muhammed, we need to consider whether there is a direct conflict between Federal Rule 4(q) and the state practice followed in Emporia regarding the commencement of a civil action for purposes of satisfying the relevant statute of limitations.\n\nStep 2: According to the information given, Federal Rule 4(q) states that a civil action in federal court is commenced, for purposes of satisfying the relevant statute of limitations, upon filing of the complaint with the clerk’s office. On the other hand, the state practice in Emporia holds that the limitations period is only satisfied if the complaint is actually served on the defendant within the statutory period.\n\nStep 3: We know from the scenario presented that Tubby files his complaint with the clerk on the last day of the limitations period, but serves the summons and complaint on Muhammed a week later. Given these facts, applying the Federal Rule would mean that the action is considered commenced on the day the complaint was filed, whereas following the state approach would result in the action being deemed untimely due to lack of service within the specified timeframe.\n\nStep 4: Considering the principles outlined in Hanna v. Plumer, particularly the distinction between Part I and Part II analyses, we recognize that our task lies in identifying whether there exists a relatively unguided conflict between federal judicial practice and state practice versus a more direct clash between a Federal Rule and state procedure.\n\nStep 5: As per the guidance from Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., we understand that courts tend to narrowly construe Federal Rules to avoid direct collisions with state law whenever feasible. Therefore, before concluding that there is indeed a direct conflict necessitating application of the Federal Rule, we must explore all avenues for reconciling the apparent discrepancy without invoking such drastic measures.",

Plumer (Part I vs. Part II)\nIn Hanna, the Court distinguished between two types of conflicts: those arising from differences in substance (Part II) and those resulting from variations in form or procedure (Part I).

            "Context": "The power of Congress to write procedural rules. In  Hanna , the Court addressed the power of Congress to promulgate rules that govern procedure in the federal courts. See 380 U.S. at 464. Analytically, it had to do so, because the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted by Congress to the Court, in the Rules Enabling Act. Surely, Congress could not delegate to the Court any broader rule-making power than it possesses itself. In  Hanna , the Court describes Congress�s rule-making authority as follows: the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. That�s a mighty broad test for Congressional power over federal court procedure: If the provision can rationally be viewed as regulating procedure, Congress may enact it, even if it will affect the outcome of litigation. Consider, however, how the Court would rule if Congress enacted a statute that impinges on state law rights that can reasonably be classified as ��substantive.��",
            "Question": "6. Limits on limitations.  Congress, in an effort to avoid complex and time-consuming litigation on the proper time for filing diversity cases in the federal courts, enacts the Federal Diversity Limitations Act (FDLA), establishing a two-year limitations period for diversity cases in the federal courts, regardless of the applicable state limitations period for the claim. Sanchez brings a diversity action against Bernstein in federal court for fraud arising out of a real estate transaction. The relevant state limitations period for fraud claims is four years. Sanchez�s suit is brought two years and five months after the alleged fraud was committed. The federal court should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  dismiss the claim under the FDLA, unless it concludes that doing so would ��abridge, enlarge or modify�� a substantive right under the REA. B.  entertain the claim, because dismissing it would lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws. C.  dismiss the claim, because the FDLA applies and bars it. D.  entertain the claim, because the limitations period is ��bound up with the rights and obligations�� of the parties.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the federal court should entertain Sanchez's claim, we need to consider the impact of the Federal Diversity Limitations Act (FDLA). The FDLA establishes a uniform two-year limitations period for all diversity actions filed in federal court, superseding potentially longer state-specific limitations periods.\n\nStep 2: Since Sanchez's claim falls within this category, the FDLA directly applies to his case. However, there might be some exceptions where the application of such a limitation period could conflict with other provisions of law, particularly those related to the enforcement of substantive rights protected by statutes like the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (REA).\n\nStep 3: Given these considerations, the Supreme Court has established a principle that when Congress exercises its power to create a new cause of action or alter existing ones through legislation affecting civil procedure, it cannot abrogate or diminish substantive rights without clear expression of intent to do so.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, before applying the FDLA to bar Sanchez's claim outright, the federal court needs to assess whether enforcing the two-year limit would effectively shorten or otherwise impair a statutory right created by the REA, thereby violating the Anti-Injunction Statute's prohibition on modifying or abolishing substantive rights.",

            "Context": "Joinder of parties under Rule 20(a). Rule 18(a) governs which  claims  a party may assert when she brings a suit against an opposing party. Rule 20(a) governs joinder of parties by the plaintiff in her complaint, that is, when the plaintiff may sue more than one defendant in the action and when she may join with other plaintiffs as coplaintiffs in a suit. First, the rule deals with joinder of multiple plaintiffs in an action: Rule 20. (a) Persons Who May Join or Be Joined. (1)  Plaintiff s. Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if: (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action. Under Rule 20(a)(1), the plaintiff decides whether to sue with one or more coplaintiffs or to go it alone. The rule sets the outer parameters: to join as coplaintiffs, the plaintiffs� claims against the defendant must arise from the same underlying events (or series of events), and involve litigation of at least one common question of either law or fact. The Rule 20(a)(1) test encourages efficient litigation. If Felina and Pai each have claims against Amory arising from the same accident, it will be more efficient to depose the witnesses once, to produce records relevant to the accident once, to try the common issue of the cause of the accident once, than to do it twice. So the rule encourages (but does not require) Felina and Pai to sue together. Rule 20(a)(2) establishes the same standard for joining multiple defendants in a single action, and does so for the same reason. It will be more efficient, and avoid inconsistent outcomes, if the plaintiff litigates her claims against different defendants together when this two-part standard is met. If some complication arises (such as a different legal standard for recovery, or defenses unique to the claim against one of the defendants), the court can always order separate trials under Rule 42(b).

Lutsky and Patrick (a passenger in Lutsky�s car), both from Arizona, are injured in a three-car collision involving Lutsky�s car and cars driven by Rowe and Bailey, both from New Mexico. Lutsky and Patrick sue Rowe in federal court, each seeking $200,000 for his injuries. The jury finds Rowe liable, and awards Lutsky $110,000, and Patrick $68,000. Rowe declares bankruptcy and does not pay. Lutsky now sues Bailey for the same injuries.",

Although he could have joined his claim against Bailey in the first action, he was not required to do so. C.  Lutsky�s claim against Bailey is not barred. A party can join with other plaintiffs or sue multiple defendants under Rule 20(a), but not both. D.

            "Context": "Back and forth: Counterclaims Rule 13, which governs ��counterclaims,�� allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1)  In General . A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that �at the time of its service�the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party�s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe�s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky�s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do  not  arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them�compulsory counterclaims�must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don�t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky�s suit?

            "Context": "Another layer of complexity: Crossclaims against coparties There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you�re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a ��crossclaim�� in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov.

Ainsley then asserts a claim against Hammer, claiming that they signed the contract for the house shortly before they separated, and that he later agreed to be responsible for the full cost of construction. She demands indemnification from Hammer if she is held liable to Milsap for the contract price, under their subsequent agreement.",

Ainsley�s claim against Hammer is a crossclaim. D.  Milsap�s claim against Hammer and Ainsley is a counterclaim.

            "Context": "Rule 14: An introduction Now let�s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the ��plaintiff is master of her claim.�� But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a ��third- party defendant�� in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover ��contribution���part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff�from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff�s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. �1367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims.",
            "Question": "6. Feeling the heat.  Firenze, a tenant in Smith�s apartment building, sues his landlord Smith, for injuries suffered in a fire in the building. Suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. He claims that Smith negligently maintained the building leading to the fire, and seeks $150,000 in damages for serious personal injuries. Smith brings in Carlson, a firefighter, as a third-party defendant, claiming that Carlson is liable to him (Smith) because, while fighting the fire, he negligently sprayed water over Smith�s computer equipment, stored in the basement, which wasn�t threatened by the blaze.",

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the claim is properly joined, we need to consider what types of claims can be joined under Rule 14(a). According to the text, a defending party like Smith can bring in a third-party defendant like Carlson when they may be liable to each other for all or part of the claim against them.\n\nStep 2: Here, Smith brings in Carlson as a third-party defendant, alleging that Carlson's negligence caused damage to Smith's property during the firefighting efforts.

Supplemental jurisdiction allows the court to hear claims that are not independently within its subject-matter jurisdiction, such as those arising under state law, if they meet certain conditions.\n\nStep 4: Given that the main case involves diversity jurisdiction, the court likely has supplemental jurisdiction over the claim against Carlson since it relates to the same underlying facts and is closely tied to the main dispute between Firenze and Smith.",

            "Context": "The constitutional and statutory reach of supplemental jurisdiction The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, �2 and others that don�t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,  the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff�s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same ��nucleus of operative fact.�� In Tolman�s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. �1331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, �2, as interpreted in  Gibbs,  to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court�s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a ��federal hook���here, the FLSA claim�from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So  Gibbs  recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman�s contract claim. But in  Kroger,  the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can�t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in  Gibbs.  Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that  Gibbs  provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger , and especially  Finley v. United States,  490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. �1367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise ��supplemental jurisdiction�� over related claims in proper federal cases. Here�s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a).  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has ��original jurisdiction,�� because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the ��same case or controversy.�� And, the legislative history of �1367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the  Gibbs  ��common nucleus of operative fact�� test are part of the same ��case or controversy.�� So, as long as the court has a federal ��hook���a claim properly within the federal court�s original jurisdiction�it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There�s more to �1367, but for now let�s focus on this basic purpose of �1367(a).",

Gibbs,  the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff’s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same “nucleus of operative fact.” In Tolman’s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. �1331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, �2, as interpreted in  Gibbs,  to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court’s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a “federal hook”—here, the FLSA claim—from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So  Gibbs  recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman’s contract claim. But in  Kroger,  the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can’t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in  Gibbs.  Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that  Gibbs  provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially  Finley v. United States,  490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. �1367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise “supplemental jurisdiction” over related claims in proper federal cases. Here’s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a).  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has “original jurisdiction,” because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the “same case or controversy.” And, the legislative history of �1367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the  Gibbs  “common nucleus of operative fact” test are part of the same “case or controversy.” So, as long as the court has a federal “hook”—a claim properly within the federal court’s original jurisdiction—it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There’s more to �1367, but for now let’s focus on this basic purpose of �1367(a).\n\nNow here is your question:\n\n\nThe constitutional and statutory reach of supplemental jurisdiction The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims.

Prior context  dealt with the simplest example of supplemental jurisdiction, joinder by the plaintiff, in the initial complaint, of a claim that satisfies federal jurisdiction with another that does not. Prior to the statute, this situation was analyzed under the rubric of ��pendent�� jurisdiction. Visually, this basic case looks like this: But supplemental jurisdiction doesn�t just apply to the plaintiff�s joinder of jurisdictionally sufficient and insufficient claims. It also extends to claims joined later in the action, such as counterclaims, cross-claims, and impleader claims. Section 1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over ��all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy,�� not just claims asserted by the plaintiff.

Pope hires Vaughan, a Utah citizen who runs a backhoe business, to come in and dig the necessary holes for the plantings. They do the work and leave. But the new shrubs die, and Jilbert claims that Vaughan ran over his underground sprinkler system and his septic system, ruining both. He sues Pope and Vaughan in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, for $90,000 in damages based on the faulty yard work. After the suit is filed, Pope asserts (in the same suit) a crossclaim against Vaughan for contribution, for half of any damages Jilbert recovers, on the ground that he was negligent as well as Pope in causing the yard damages. He also asserts a claim against Vaughan for $5,000 in damages that resulted when Vaughan hit his riding mower while working on another job.",

The court has supplemental jurisdiction over both of Pope�s claims against Vaughan, under �1367(a). D.  The court lacks jurisdiction over either of Pope�s claims against Vaughan. Even adding together the $5,000 in damages for the mower and $45,000 (contribution for half of Jilbert�s damages) on the contribution claim, Pope does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement, so there is no ��original jurisdiction�� over his claims against Vaughan.

            "Context": "Limits on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases: Section 1367 (b). The grant of supplemental jurisdiction in �1367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in  Gibbs.  However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in �1367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in �1367(b), which bars jurisdiction�even if the test in �1367(a) is satisfied�over certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a �1367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in �1367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that �1367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with  Kroger  in mind.  Kroger  had suggested that the federal courts shouldn�t always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in  Gibbs. Kroger  held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss,  7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. �1367(b), Congress sought to preserve the  Kroger  limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b).  In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in  diversity cases only , the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain  claims by plaintiffs  or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just  some  claims, defined in �1367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in �1367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can�t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge  would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn�t. So �1367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under �1367(a). Section 1367(b) isn�t too bad if you approach it in steps. �  First , ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn�t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says ��in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .�� �  Next , if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn�t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain ��claims by plaintiffs�� (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word ��plaintiff�� means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a ��plaintiff�� on a counterclaim. �  Then , if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim ��against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24�� of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. �  Or , if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. �  Last , just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for  original jurisdiction  over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in �1367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there�s no diversity, and who cares that �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in �1367(a) applies, and then whether �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.",

This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in  diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain  claims by plaintiffs  or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just  some  claims, defined in �1367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in �1367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can’t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge  would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn’t.

If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in �1367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there’s no diversity, and who cares that �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help.

If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in �1367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there’s no diversity, and who cares that �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in �1367(a) applies, and then whether �1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.6.

            "Context": "��Pendent party�� jurisdiction Before �1367 was enacted, the federal courts decided a number of cases involving ��pendent party jurisdiction.�� In  Finley v. United States , for example, the California plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), seeking damages from a plane crash in California. The federal court had jurisdiction, because the case was against the United States. Cases in which the United States is a party are authorized by Article III, �2 of the Constitution, and the FTCA authorizes, indeed, requires tort claims against the United States to be filed in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. �1346(b). But the Finleys also had claims against other parties�California citizens�arising out of the same accident. They asserted those claims in the federal suit as well, and asked the court to take ��pendent party�� jurisdiction over them. The argument for this is based on  Gibbs.  The federal court had original jurisdiction in  Finley  based on the proper federal claim against the United States. And the plaintiffs� claims against the California defendants arose out of the same set of facts, the plane crash. So the plaintiffs argued that the court could hang the jurisdictionally insufficient claims against the California defendants from the other, jurisdictionally proper claim against the United States. It�s just another exercise of pendent jurisdiction, they argued, except that the jurisdictionally insufficient claim is asserted (unlike typical pendent jurisdiction cases like  Gibbs ) against a different party. Visually, it looks like this: In  Finley , the Supreme Court suggested that pendent party jurisdiction might be constitutionally permissible under  Gibbs , since the claims against the added parties arose from the same underlying facts as the FTCA claim. But the Court then looked to the second requirement, whether Congress, in the FTCA, had authorized jurisdiction over the related state law claims. Since it saw no indication that Congress had done so, it rejected pendent party jurisdiction in that case. In the supplemental jurisdiction statute, Congress responded to the Court�s reminder in  Finley  that Congress must authorize such exercises of federal jurisdiction. In the second sentence of �1367(a), Congress expressly authorized supplemental jurisdiction over claims by or against added parties: ��Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.�� So, if the basic standard for jurisdiction over an added claim is met�that it arises from the same case or controversy as the main claim�it may be asserted even if it is asserted against a new party. Of course, �1367(b) must still be consulted, since it limits the broad scope of �1367(a) in certain diversity cases. Here�s a nice little mind-bender to help you sort out the limits of pendent party jurisdiction under �1367.",
            "Question": "7. Added, but not authorized.  In which of the following cases would the federal court have jurisdiction over the last-mentioned claim? In each, assume that Richards Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in New York. Ortega is a citizen of New Jersey. 1.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets. The suit is brought in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, and seeks $100,000 in damages. Ortega counterclaims for patent infringement, based on the company�s decision, unrelated to the trade secret dispute, to market a device on which he claimed to hold a patent. He demands $60,000 in damages on the counterclaim. 2.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets, which led to his discharge. The suit is brought in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, and seeks $100,000 in damages. Ortega counterclaims for breach of contract, based on the same events that led the company to discharge him. He seeks $40,000 in damages. Richards then brings in Suriyama, a former vice president for personnel, under Rule 14(b). It claims that Suriyama, a New Yorker, misled the company about Ortega�s conduct, leading it to dismiss Ortega. Richards seeks indemnification for any damages it must pay Ortega on the counterclaim. 3.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets. The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking $100,000 in damages. Richards also makes Carson, a New York employee, a codefendant in the case, claiming damages for fraud. The claim against Carson arises out of the same events as the claim against Ortega and also seeks $100,000 in damages. 4.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega for trademark infringement, a federal claim. In the same action, it asserts a claim against Sheindienst, an employee from New York, for fraud, arising from the same events as the claim against Ortega.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  1, 2, and 3. B.  2 and 3 only. C.  1 only. D.  1 and 4 only.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine when the federal court has jurisdiction over the last-mentioned claim in each scenario, we need to apply the principles outlined in the supplemental jurisdiction statute, specifically § 1367.\n\nStep 2: For scenario 1, the initial lawsuit involves diversity jurisdiction between Richards Corporation and Ortega, with both sides seeking monetary damages. However, Ortega's counterclaim for patent infringement does not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim; instead, it relates to a separate issue regarding marketing a device. Therefore, according to § 1367(b)(2)(C), there is no independent basis for subject-matter jurisdiction over the counterclaim, making it ineligible for supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Moving to scenario 2, the situation is similar to scenario 1, where Ortega files a counterclaim for breach of contract stemming from the same events that led to his dismissal. This time, however, the claim directly pertains to the core issues surrounding Ortega's employment termination. As per § 1367(a)'s authorization for supplemental jurisdiction over claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties, especially considering the close connection between the main claim and the counterclaim, the federal court should have jurisdiction over Ortega's counterclaim.\n\nStep 4: Scenario 3 presents a situation where Richards Corporation adds Carson, a New York employee, as a codefendant due to allegations of fraud tied to the same incidents as the trade-secret misappropriation claim against Ortega. Given that these claims share the same factual foundation, the addition of Carson as a defendant falls within the purview of supplemental jurisdiction allowed by § 1367(a).\n\nStep 5: Finally, examining scenario 4, the primary claim against Ortega concerns trademark infringement, a federal question. Simultaneously, Richards Corporation pursues a claim against Sheindienst for fraud, which stems from the identical circumstances as the claim against Ortega. Because the federal question provides an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction, the inclusion of Sheindienst as a defendant aligns with the provisions of § 1367(a).",

            "Context": "Section 1367 (b) and the amount in controversy requirement. Before the supplemental jurisdiction statute was enacted, the case law had held that in a diversity case, each plaintiff had to meet the amount in controversy requirement independently against each defendant. Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier�s damages were $120,000, and Ives�s were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. �1332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier�s, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim  himself  for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the  text of �1367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services , 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.",

Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for breach of contract, after he is fired by Pariah on the ground that he, along with Westford, had embezzled funds from Pariah. Cavers sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Westford, another Wisconsin citizen, was also fired for the embezzlement, and joins as a coplaintiff in the suit, seeking $40,000 in damages.

D.  have jurisdiction over Westford�s claim under �1367(a), but his claim is barred because it is inconsistent with the diversity requirements of �1332, since it does not meet the amount in controversy requirement.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether the district court has jurisdiction over Westford's claim, we need to analyze the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Section 1367(a) provides that in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the “same case or controversy” under Article III of the United States Constitution.\n\nStep 2: Since Cavers' claim meets the amount-in-controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction, the district court has original jurisdiction over this claim. Therefore, pursuant to section 1367(a), the district court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Westford’s claim, assuming it forms part of the same case or controversy.\n\nStep 3: Next, we consider whether Westford's claim satisfies the standard for forming part of the same case or controversy. This requires determining whether there is a common nucleus of operative fact between Cavers’ and Westford’s claims. Here, both plaintiffs were allegedly involved in the same embezzlement scheme and suffered similar injuries when they were terminated by Pariah Corporation. These facts suggest that their claims share a common nucleus of operative fact.\n\nStep 4: Having established that Westford's claim shares a common nucleus of operative fact with Cavers', we now turn our attention to section 1367(b), which sets forth certain exceptions to the grant of supplemental jurisdiction. One exception applies where a state-law claim is presented in a case otherwise arising under federal law exclusively; however, here neither party suggests that the underlying dispute arises under federal law exclusively. Another exception bars supplemental jurisdiction over a claim that involves a party who is already a party to the main action solely because of a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint by that person.

This ��short and plain statement�� requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff�s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations.

Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant�s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures.

For many years, federal courts applied the standard of  Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 42 (1957), in determining the sufficiency of a complaint. In  Conley , the Supreme Court held that ��a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.�� Id. at 45-46. This standard was very indulgent toward the plaintiff. If the court, looking at the allegations in the complaint, could imagine facts consistent with the pleading that would establish a violation�any violation�of the plaintiff�s legal rights, the complaint should not be dismissed. The plaintiff should get her shot at discovery to establish those facts.

The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is  notice  to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This ��short and plain statement�� requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff�s claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant�s negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff�s favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.

            "Context": "Pleading alternatively or inconsistently. Under early English pleading, from which our own pleading rules evolved, a plaintiff was required to stake his case on one version of the facts and law. He could not, for example, plead in one count that the defendant breached a contract with him, and in another that he could recover for fraud. He could not proceed in assumpsit, for breach of contract, and plead replevin, based on a different writ, in the same action. He had to choose a particular theory. Similarly, he had to take one position from the outset about the facts, and stick with it through trial. He couldn�t plead in one count that the defendant acted as an employee of Ace Motor Company at the time of the events in suit, and plead in another claim that he acted as an independent contractor. Common law pleading demanded ruthless efficiency and tough tactical choices. Even if the plaintiff wasn�t sure when he pleaded what the evidence would ultimately show on the issue�and couldn�t be at the time of pleading� he had to commit himself at the outset. A party was required to elect a particular set of facts and a legal theory at the pleading stage. Unfortunately, this forced a litigant to set forth his allegations with a degree of certainty that often was not warranted in terms of the state of his knowledge at that point in the case. If the facts he asserted in the pleadings were not confirmed by later proof, the action or defense would fail even if his proof demonstrated a right to relief on some other theory. Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure  �1282. The Federal Rules rebel against such rigid constraints at the pleading stage. Under Rule 8(d)(3), the plaintiff may assert as many alternative versions of the claim as he has evidence to support, may include both legal and equitable claims in the same complaint, and may assert different versions of a claim ��regardless of consistency.�� The Rules recognize that, when the plaintiff drafts the complaint, he may not be able to predict what facts will ultimately be found by the jury at trial. For example, it may be impossible at the outset of a case, without discovery, for the plaintiff to know whether a defendant acted as an independent contractor or as an employee. That�s a complex factual issue, which is governed by a fairly ambiguous, multifactor test. See Restatement (Second) of Agency, �220. Ultimately, if the issue must be determined in the case, the jury will decide it based on the evidence presented at trial. The plaintiff�s lawyer isn�t required to stake his case on the prediction of what that determination will be. Under Rule 11, he may allege different versions of his claim, alleging one basis for recovery if the defendant is found to be an employee, and another if he is found to be an independent contractor, so long as he has evidentiary support for each position. Similarly, he may demand different relief, depending on which claim he proves at trial. As the case unfolds, the plaintiff may abandon one version or another of his claim if it becomes clear that one is unsupported. If, however, he has support for multiple versions of his claim after discovery, he may attempt to prove each version of his claim for which he has supporting evidence at trial.

He seeks damages from Munson for the past interference.\n\n\nStep 3: In Count Two, Giscard makes similar allegations against Bigby, claiming that Bigby's actions have caused the same problem. Again, he seeks damages from Bigby for the past interference.\n\n\nStep 4: However, there seems to be no inconsistency between Counts One and Two regarding the cause of the alleged injury - both counts attribute the problem to the defendants' respective actions.\n\n\nStep 5: Furthermore, Giscard seeks identical relief in both counts - damages for past interference.\n\n\nStep 6: Therefore, considering these points, we cannot conclude that Giscards pleading is inconsistent because he did not make contradictory statements about either the causes of the injuries or the requested remedies.\n\n\nStep 7: Now let us consider Option B, where it says that Giscard has pleaded inconsistently by seeking damages for the past interference, but an injunction against future interference.\n\n\nStep 8: This statement does seem accurate since Giscard requests two distinct forms of relief - monetary compensation for prior wrongs versus court-ordered prevention of ongoing issues.\n\n\nStep 9: Nonetheless, according to the rule mentioned earlier, pleading alternately or inconsistently is allowed under certain circumstances.\n\n\nStep 10: Since Giscard is requesting different kinds of relief, albeit related to the same underlying dispute, this might indeed qualify as permitted behavior under the applicable rule.\n\n\nStep 11: Thus, despite initial reservations, it appears plausible that Giscard's pleading strategy aligns with the principles outlined in the given text.\n\n\nStep 12: We should now evaluate Options C and D before reaching a final decision.\n\n\nStep 13: According to Option C, Giscard has pleaded inconsistently both with regard to the defendant who caused the harm and with regard to the type of relief, but this is permissible under Rule 8(d)(3).\n\n\nStep 14: While true that Giscard attributes the issue differently among defendants, this discrepancy doesn't necessarily indicate pleading inconsistency; rather, it reflects varying culpability attributed to each defendant.\n\n\nStep 15: Moreover, the request for different types of relief remains consistent across all counts, focusing primarily on redressing past harms via financial restitution.\n\n\nStep 16: Hence, although Giscard's approach involves nuanced distinctions within his narrative, it still falls within acceptable parameters established by the pertinent rule.\n\n\nStep 17: Moving forward, let's assess Option D, stating that Giscard hasn't pleaded inconsistently.\n\n\nStep 18: Given the preceding discussion highlighting potential inconsistencies in Giscard's pleading style, particularly concerning the nature of relief sought, this assertion appears inaccurate.\n\n\nStep 19: Based on the detailed examination above, we've identified areas where Giscard's pleading exhibits characteristics associated with inconsistency.\n\n\nStep 20: Consequently, acknowledging these discrepancies allows us to accurately classify Giscard's pleading strategy relative to the options provided.",

            "Context": "Pleading alternatively or inconsistently. Under early English pleading, from which our own pleading rules evolved, a plaintiff was required to stake his case on one version of the facts and law. He could not, for example, plead in one count that the defendant breached a contract with him, and in another that he could recover for fraud. He could not proceed in assumpsit, for breach of contract, and plead replevin, based on a different writ, in the same action. He had to choose a particular theory. Similarly, he had to take one position from the outset about the facts, and stick with it through trial. He couldn�t plead in one count that the defendant acted as an employee of Ace Motor Company at the time of the events in suit, and plead in another claim that he acted as an independent contractor. Common law pleading demanded ruthless efficiency and tough tactical choices. Even if the plaintiff wasn�t sure when he pleaded what the evidence would ultimately show on the issue�and couldn�t be at the time of pleading� he had to commit himself at the outset. A party was required to elect a particular set of facts and a legal theory at the pleading stage. Unfortunately, this forced a litigant to set forth his allegations with a degree of certainty that often was not warranted in terms of the state of his knowledge at that point in the case. If the facts he asserted in the pleadings were not confirmed by later proof, the action or defense would fail even if his proof demonstrated a right to relief on some other theory. Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure  �1282. The Federal Rules rebel against such rigid constraints at the pleading stage. Under Rule 8(d)(3), the plaintiff may assert as many alternative versions of the claim as he has evidence to support, may include both legal and equitable claims in the same complaint, and may assert different versions of a claim ��regardless of consistency.�� The Rules recognize that, when the plaintiff drafts the complaint, he may not be able to predict what facts will ultimately be found by the jury at trial. For example, it may be impossible at the outset of a case, without discovery, for the plaintiff to know whether a defendant acted as an independent contractor or as an employee. That�s a complex factual issue, which is governed by a fairly ambiguous, multifactor test. See Restatement (Second) of Agency, �220. Ultimately, if the issue must be determined in the case, the jury will decide it based on the evidence presented at trial. The plaintiff�s lawyer isn�t required to stake his case on the prediction of what that determination will be. Under Rule 11, he may allege different versions of his claim, alleging one basis for recovery if the defendant is found to be an employee, and another if he is found to be an independent contractor, so long as he has evidentiary support for each position. Similarly, he may demand different relief, depending on which claim he proves at trial. As the case unfolds, the plaintiff may abandon one version or another of his claim if it becomes clear that one is unsupported. If, however, he has support for multiple versions of his claim after discovery, he may attempt to prove each version of his claim for which he has supporting evidence at trial. Here�s a thought-provoking question that considers the meaning of Rule 8(d)(3).",

Singh sues Nuclear Processing Corporation, his former employer, for exposing him to radiation during his employment at its plant for processing nuclear power plant wastes.

In the second claim for relief, he asserts that Nuclear was aware at the time of his employment that its facility exposed employees to elevated radiation levels that could cause leukemia, but failed to warn him of that risk or take steps to reduce it. In the third claim for relief, he alleges that after he had left Nuclear�s employ, it learned of the risk of leukemia from the radiation levels its employees encountered at the facility, but failed to warn him so that he could obtain proper medical treatment and monitoring.",

First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren�t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a ��denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.�� If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn�t know, or doesn�t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she ��lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.�� Fed.

            "Context": "The Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can�t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff�s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn�t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to ��overplead�� affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of ��boilerplate�� defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties� real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here�s a question that explores the defendant�s options.",

Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which is necessary in order to recover from the employer). When it answers the complaint, AE has some information suggesting that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time, but also some information suggesting that he was not.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  AE should admit and deny that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident, since it has some information that would support both positions. B.  AE should not answer this allegation, since it doesn�t know whether Adair acted in the scope of employment or not. C.  AE should answer that it is ��without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of [the] allegation in Paragraph 4.�� This will constitute an admission of the allegation, but AE could move to amend its answer if it learns through discovery that Adair did not act in the scope of employment. D.  AE should deny the allegation.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine how to respond to paragraph 4 of Patterson's complaint, we need to consider what each possible response entails under the federal rules of civil procedure.\n\n\nStep 2: If AE admits the allegation, then it is essentially conceding that Adair was acting within the scope of employment when the accident occurred. However, admitting something that is disputed does not necessarily mean that AE believes it to be true; rather, it means that there is enough evidence to suggest that it might be true.\n\n\nStep 3: On the other hand, denying the allegation outright suggests that AE has reason to believe that Adair was not acting within the scope of employment during the incident. But given that AE has some information supporting both possibilities, simply denying the allegation might not accurately reflect their position.\n\n\nStep 4: Option B states that AE shouldn't answer because it doesn't know whether Adair acted in the scope of employment or not. While lack of knowledge is sometimes a valid basis for responding to a pleading, here it seems like AE actually has some information regarding the issue - just not conclusive proof either way.\n\n\nStep 5: Therefore, neither admitting nor denying the allegation entirely aligns perfectly with AE's situation. Instead, they're left with two remaining choices: answering that they don't have enough information to make a determination, which risks being seen as an implicit concession of the point, or taking no action altogether, which could lead to default judgments down the line due to non-compliance with procedural requirements.\n\n\nStep 6: Considering these factors, the best course of action appears to be acknowledging uncertainty via a specific type of denial available under FRCP 8(b), allowing room for further investigation before making definitive assertions about the matter at hand.",

            "Context": "Pleading multiple defenses and objections At common law, the defendant could take a number of positions regarding the case. She could ��traverse the allegations,�� that is, deny the truth of the facts. If she did that, the case would go to trial to resolve the disputed facts. Or the defendant could ��demur to the complaint,�� that is, assert that the facts alleged, if proved, would not entitle the plaintiff to relief. This challenged the sufficiency of the averments in the complaint to support recovery under the law, not the factual truth of those averments. Or, the defendant could assert that, despite the validity of the plaintiff�s prima facie claim, she loses anyway, due to some additional fact, such as the passage of the statute of limitations, or a release of the claim by settlement. Last, the defendant could raise various objections to the court�s going forward, such as improper venue or lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Strict common law pleading did not allow the defendant to raise all of these defenses. If the defendant ��traversed,�� she couldn�t demur as well. If she raised new matter to avoid liability (called a ��confession and avoidance��), she had to admit the truth of the plaintiff�s allegations and rely solely on the defense to it�she had to ��confess�� in order to ��avoid.�� For example, if she wanted to raise the statute of limitations as a defense to a contract claim, she couldn�t  also  deny that she ever made the contract: to raise the limitations defense (��the avoidance��) she had to confess the validity of the plaintiff�s basic claim. Through this ruthless insistence that the defendant put all her eggs in one basket, the common law pleading system boiled cases down to single issues. A demurrer reduced it to the single question of law, ��does the plaintiff�s complaint state a claim upon which relief can be granted?�� Traversing the allegations reduced it to a dispute over the truth of the factual allegations. And a confession and avoidance reduced it to the validity of the affirmative defense (since the defendant, by raising one, admitted the truth of the plaintiff�s case-in-chief). Maitland declared that ��the forms of action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.�� 4  The old pleading rules are largely gone, but much of their substance remains. As under the common law, federal pleading recognizes traverses�they are denials under Rule 8(b). It recognizes demurrers�now challenges to the legal validity of the plaintiff�s claim under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c). Similarly, federal pleading allows parties to avoid liability by raising affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c). Last, a defendant may also interpose procedural objections to the case, such as improper venue or lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction. See Rule 12(b)(1), (2), (3). Plus �a change, plus c�est la m�me. . . . 5  But there is an important difference from the common law. Under the Federal Rules, the defendant (much like the plaintiff in her complaint) may raise multiple objections to the plaintiff�s case; she is not required to stake her case on one. She may deny that the parties made a contract, but also raise the affirmative defense that the limitations period bars enforcing it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1), which gives a (non-exhaustive) list of affirmative defenses that may be included in an answer. She may deny that she caused emotional distress to the plaintiff, but also claim that there�s no cause of action for infliction of emotional distress and that the court lacks jurisdiction over her. And so on. Once again, the Rules flexibly allow the pleader to state whatever positions she has evidentiary support for, ��regardless of consistency.�� But the various positions are, basically, recognizable descendants of common law devices: the traverse, the demurrer, the confession and avoidance, or pleas to the court�s jurisdiction. It�s useful to be able to classify defenses appropriately under these four categories. This question offers a chance to do that.",

Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc. in federal court, for injuries suffered in an accident while he was a passenger in a truck with Adair, one of AE�s delivery drivers. He bases jurisdiction on diversity. Patterson�s complaint alleges that he is an employee of AE, that Adair is also an AE employee, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident, and that Adair was negligent in causing the accident. The jurisdiction applies joint and several liability. In its answer, AE asserts the following defenses (among others): 1.  ��Adair was not negligent, because he acted reasonably in a sudden emergency.�� 2.  ��The court lacks power to hear the case, because Patterson is from the same state as AE.�� 3.  ��The plaintiff cannot recover, because he is covered by the workers compensation statute, which bars suits by a covered employee against his employer. She may only recover statutory benefits from the workers� compensation insurer.�� 4.  ��The plaintiff cannot recover from the defendant because the injury resulted solely from the negligence of Chang, the other driver involved in the accident.�� 5.  ��The plaintiff cannot recover, because in riding in the open bed of the truck, he was more negligent than Adair.�� (Under the relevant comparative negligence statute, a plaintiff who is more negligent than the defendant is not entitled to recover.)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  AE�s answer contains a denial, a jurisdictional objection, one defense of failure to state a claim, and two affirmative defenses. B.

AE�s answer contains two denials, two defenses of failure to state a claim, and one affirmative defense.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's identify each part of the answer given by AE. Defense #1 says that Adair wasn't negligent - this is a denial of the allegation that Adair was negligent. Denial is recognized under Rule 8(b).\n\nStep 2: Next, look at Defense #2. Here, AE claims that the Court doesn't have power to hear the case because Patterson is from the same State as AE. This is a challenge to the court's jurisdiction, specifically arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Patterson. Challenges to jurisdiction fall within Rule 12(b)(1).\n\nStep 3: Now consider Defense #3. Here, AE argues that even assuming everything else in the Complaint were true, Patterson wouldn't win because he's barred from suing his employer by the Workers' Compensation Statute. This argument attacks the merits of the Plaintiff's claim, claiming that even if the underlying facts are assumed to be true, the Plaintiff won't prevail. Therefore, this falls under a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of the pleadings, i.e., a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nStep 4: Moving along, examine Defense #4. Here, AE states that the injury occurred entirely through the fault of another party, namely Chang. This is an Affirmative Defense since it admits the truth of the underlying facts asserted by Patterson but seeks to establish a reason why Patterson should nonetheless lose. Thus, this fits within the category of affirmative defenses allowed under Rule 8(c).\n\nStep 5: Finally, analyze Defense #5. Here, AE maintains that Patterson himself bears greater responsibility for the harm than does Adair. Since this compares the relative degrees of fault between Patterson and Adair, it qualifies as an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c).",

Malone answers the complaint twenty days after receiving it, on January 22, denying negligence. At the end of her answer, under a separate heading entitled ��Counterclaim,�� she asserts a counterclaim against Farrell, claiming that Farrell agreed to deliver forty pots to Malone for sale in her shop, and didn�t do so. Farrell files an answer to the counterclaim on January 29, asserting that she never agreed to deliver the pots and that the contract is not enforceable because it was not in writing. After receiving Farrell�s answer to the counterclaim, Malone�s counsel realizes that Farrell�s second argument is valid: The contract for the pots is not enforceable under the applicable statute of frauds because it was not in writing. Consequently, on February 16, Malone serves an amended counterclaim on Farrell, changing her theory to misrepresentation, a tort claim, based on Farrell�s statements promising prompt delivery of the pots.",
            "Options": "Options: A. The amendment is proper without leave of court, since the amended counterclaim was filed within twenty-one days after Farrell�s answer to the counterclaim.\nB. The amendment will need leave of court, since Farrell has already served a responsive pleading to the counterclaim.\nC. The amendment is not proper without leave of court, since it was filed more than twenty-one days after Malone filed her answer to the original complaint.\nD. The counterclaim cannot be amended, since the period for amendments as of right has passed.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we determine whether the situation described falls under the category where amendments are permitted �as a matter of course.� This involves identifying if there's been a responsive pleading made by the other side, specifically looking at when such a pleading occurred relative to the proposed amendment.\n\nStep 2: In this scenario, Malone initially responds with an answer to the complaint on January 22, including a counterclaim. Then, Farrell responds to the counterclaim on January 29. We're considering an amendment to the counterclaim on February 16.\n\nStep 3: According to the rules, if a responding party makes a pleading, then the initial pleader gets another chance to amend their own pleading without needing permission from the judge. However, this rule applies differently depending on how long ago the last pleading was made.\n\nStep 4: Specifically, if the last pleading was made less than twenty-one days prior to the filing of the new pleading, the initial pleader can make changes freely (\"as a matter of course\"). Otherwise, they would typically require judicial approval before making significant alterations.\n\nStep 5: Since Farrell answered the counterclaim on January 29, and Malone wants to change her counterclaim strategy nearly three weeks later, on February 16, we check if twenty-one days have elapsed between these dates.\n\nStep 6: Counting forward from January 29 gives us approximately March 20 as the date twenty-one days later. Therefore, almost four months pass between Farrell answering the counterclaim and Malone attempting to modify it.\n\nStep 7: Given that over twenty-one days have lapsed since Farrell responded to the counterclaim, Malone does not qualify for the automatic amendment privilege anymore; instead, she needs to seek permission from the court to alter her counterclaim.",

            "updated_reasoning": ":\n\n\n\nStep 1: To begin solving this problem, let's clarify what constitutes a \"responsive pleading.\" Under the Federal Rules, a responsive pleading includes an answer to a complaint, as well as responses to certain types of claims raised in the complaint, like counterclaims or crossclaims. Here, Malone included a counterclaim in her answer to Farrell's complaint.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Next, we examine the timeline provided in the problem. Malone initially responds with an answer to the complaint on January 22, including a counterclaim. Farrell subsequently files an answer to the counterclaim on January 29. Now, Malone seeks to amend her counterclaim on February 16.\n\n\n\nStep 3: There are indeed some nuances regarding the ability to amend pleadings without needing permission from the court. Generally speaking, if a party receives a responsive pleading, they get another opportunity to revise their own pleading without needing court authorization. However, this window closes after twenty-one days have passed since the receipt of the responsive pleading.\n\n\n\nStep 4: When assessing whether the last pleading was submitted fewer than twenty-one days prior to the current attempt to amend, we should focus on the specific event triggering the clock – namely, the date when Farrell replied to Malone's counterclaim.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Instead of relying solely on counting forward from January 29, it would be better to use a calendar or perform a precise calculation to ascertain the exact duration between Farrell's reply to the counterclaim and Malone's subsequent effort to amend hers.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Upon recalculating the timeframe, taking into account both the start and end points correctly, we find that significantly more than twenty-one days elapse between Farrell's response to the counterclaim and Malone's attempted revision.\n\n\n\nStep 7: While requesting permission from the court could potentially allow Malone to proceed with revising her counterclaim, several variables beyond mere request status influence the likelihood of obtaining approval.",

            "Context": "Relation back of amendments. Special problems arise when the plaintiff seeks to amend to add additional claims, or change the nature of her claims, after the statute of limitations has expired. The rule-makers addressed this problem in Rule 15(c). Let�s start with Rule 15(c)(1), which deals with the most common situation, in which the plaintiff files the complaint within the limitations period, the limitations period passes, and later the plaintiff wants to amend her complaint to add another claim. Rule 15(c)(1) provides: When an Amendment Relates Back.  An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out�or attempted to be set out�in the original pleading . . . What does it mean that the amendment ��relates back�� if it arises from the same underlying events alleged in the original pleading? It means that the amended complaint, containing the new claim, will be treated as though it had been filed when the original complaint was filed. What�s the point of this? It is intended to make clear that the statute of limitations is not a defense to new claims in the amended complaint, any more than it was to the original claim.  Assume that Roberts sues Morales for breach of contract, based on the sale of a quantity of men�s suits Morales sold to him on March 15, 2013. He files suit on March 1, 2016, just before the three-year limitations period for contract claims in the relevant jurisdiction runs out. Four months later, he moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted the tort of fraud, a claim that also has a three-year limitations period. If Roberts had brought  no suit  until July of 2011, and then sued Morales for fraud, the fraud claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. But here, Roberts  did  sue Morales for this sale of goods before the passage of the limitations period. All he wants to do now is to add to his complaint another theory of recovery for the sale. Under Rule 15(c)(1) (B), if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016, before the statute of limitations passed. Why does the rule allow this bit of legal fiction? The purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure that the defendant has notice of a claim within a given period of time, so she can adequately prepare to defend that claim. Here, Roberts put Morales on notice that he would have to defend his conduct involving the March 15, 2013 sale when he sued him on March 1, 2011, within the limitations period. Morales should realize, as of that date, that he will have to defend that sale, and gather the evidence to do so before it disappears. True, he thinks he has to defend a contract claim  based on the sale, not a fraud claim. But Rule 15(c)(1)(B) reflects the rule-makers� conclusion that, once a defendant has been put on notice that particular conduct will be litigated�the March 15, 2013 sale�the purpose of the limitations period is satisfied. Consequently, since Roberts sued Morales for the sale before the limitations period ran, Roberts should be allowed to assert whatever claims or theories he has arising from that sale, even if he thinks of additional theories later. Otherwise, Roberts would have to develop his whole case before March 15, 2013, not just sue Morales by that date. Here�s an example to illustrate the point.",

He files suit on March 1, 2016, just before the three-year limitations period for contract claims in the relevant jurisdiction runs out. Four months later, he moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted the tort of fraud, a claim that also has a three-year limitations period. If Roberts had brought  no suit  until July of 2011, and then sued Morales for fraud, the fraud claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. But here, Roberts  did  sue Morales for this sale of goods before the passage of the limitations period. All he wants to do now is to add to his complaint another theory of recovery for the sale. Under Rule 15(c)(1) (B), if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016, before the statute of limitations passed. Why does the rule allow this bit of legal fiction? The purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure that the defendant has notice of a claim within a given period of time, so she can adequately prepare to defend that claim. Here, Roberts put Morales on notice that he would have to defend his conduct involving the March 15, 2013 sale when he sued him on March 1, 2011, within the limitations period. Morales should realize, as of that date, that he will have to defend that sale, and gather the evidence to do so before it disappears. True, he thinks he has to defend a contract claim  based on the sale, not a fraud claim. But Rule 15(c)(1)(B) reflects the rule-makers� conclusion that, once a defendant has been put on notice that particular conduct will be litigated�the March 15, 2013 sale�the purpose of the limitations period is satisfied. Consequently, since Roberts sued Morales for the sale before the limitations period ran, Roberts should be allowed to assert whatever claims or theories he has arising from that sale, even if he thinks of additional theories later. Otherwise, Roberts would have to develop his whole case before March 15, 2013, not just sue Morales by that date. Here�s an example to illustrate the point.",
            "Question": "6. Amendment rights?  In March 2014, shortly after a new mayor takes office, Harcourt is fired from her job as a City administrator. She sues the City for breach of contract in February 2016, one month before the two-year limitations period passes. The parties conduct discovery over the course of seventeen months. In July 2017, just before the pre-trial conference, Harcourt moves to amend to add a federal civil rights claim to her complaint, alleging that she was fired because she belonged to the outgoing mayor�s party, and that the firing violates her First Amendment rights. A three-year limitations period applies to the civil rights claim. The judge holds a hearing on the motion to amend, and indicates reluctance to allow the motion, because it comes late in the litigation.",

            "Context": "Amendments to add parties under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). There are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will ��relate back�� to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a  new defendant  to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will ��relate back�� to the date the original complaint was filed. �  First , the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). �  Second , the defendant being added must have ��received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.�� Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. �  Third , the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment ��knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party�s identity.�� Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy�s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it�Tel- Connect�was actually the intended target of the suit. What�s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint 2 ) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).",

            "Context": "Amendments under Rule 15(b) to conform to the evidence While the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn�t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties� discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side�s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff�s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant�s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1)  Based on an Objection at Trial.  If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party�s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings�at the trial itself�to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff�s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not ��tried by the parties� express or implied consent.�� Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here�s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b).",
            "Question": "8. Ups and downs.  Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala�s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should",

D.  deny the amendment, since the parties did not impliedly try the issue of assumption of the risk.",

            "Context": "The basic purpose and provisions of Rule 11 The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11?

            "Context": "The standard for proper legal contentions under Rule 11 Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don�t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts� time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a ��nonfrivolous argument�� for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such ��nonfrivolous�� arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don�t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: ��I�m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?�� You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, ��Yes, your honor, I know that I�m arguing to overrule  Flores v. Jones , the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.�� Or, ��Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court�s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.�� Arguments like those are ��nonfrivolous.�� The advocate is not just saying, ��I think the law should be otherwise,�� but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.",
            "Question": "3. Fighting an uphill battle.  In which of the following cases, filed in federal district in West Carolina, might the lawyer be subject to sanctions for violating Rule 11(b)(2)?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a stranger was grievously injured. Although he knows that the West Carolina Supreme Court denied recovery for witnessing injury to a stranger ten months ago, Williams suffered very serious emotional trauma from the experience, and desperately needs funds for his psychiatric bills. B.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which her son was grievously injured. West Carolina has never addressed the right to recover for indirect infliction of emotional distress (that is, distress caused by witnessing injury to another person). C.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a close friend was grievously injured and died at the scene. The West Carolina Supreme Court recognized a right to recover for indirect infliction in 2002, but the opinion emphasized that the plaintiff was a close relative of the injured party. D.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a stranger was grievously injured. West Carolina recognized a right to recover for indirect infliction for witnessing serious injury to a family member in 2002, but in 2018 the West Carolina Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who witnessed injury to her fianc�e could not recover for indirect infliction. The unanimous opinion expressed concern about creating ��unreasonably broad tort liability.�� E.  Both  A  and  D  might subject Garcia to sanctions.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether attorney Garcia may be subject to sanctions for violating Rule 11(b)(2), we first consider each scenario presented in options A through E.\n\nStep 2: Option A presents a situation where Garcia's client, Williams, seeks compensation for witnessing an accident involving a stranger due to severe emotional trauma experienced after the incident. However, the West Carolina Supreme Court had previously denied such claims within the past year. Given this recent denial, filing a claim similar to this without substantial justification or evidence supporting a departure from prior rulings could potentially violate Rule 11(b)(2).\n\nStep 3: Moving to option B, Garcia's client, Williams, alleges damages resulting from witnessing an accident affecting someone else. Since no ruling exists regarding indirect infliction of emotional distress in West Carolina, Garcia's assertion appears reasonable as it falls outside the realm of well-established law.\n\nStep 4: Considering option C, although the West Carolina Supreme Court did recognize a right to recover for indirect infliction in 2002, their emphasis on proximity between the witness and victim suggests that direct familial ties were crucial factors in determining eligibility for compensation. Therefore, attempting to extend this principle beyond immediate relatives might raise concerns under Rule 11(b)(2).\n\nStep 5: Examining option D, despite initial recognition of rights for witnesses experiencing emotional distress upon seeing injuries inflicted upon loved ones, subsequent decisions limiting these protections further underscore caution against advocating overly expansive interpretations of existing laws.\n\nStep 6: Finally, evaluating both scenarios described in option E reveals potential vulnerabilities for Garcia under Rule 11(b)(2): Attempting to assert claims grounded in circumstances already deemed insufficiently compelling by higher authorities risks being seen as frivolous.",

This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That�s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line.

She claims that she was making $100,000 a year and is now unemployed. Garcia quickly files a complaint in federal court based on her story, alleging the facts above and demanding damages under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

Although technically true, this interpretation misses the point of Rule 11(b)(3)'s requirement for pre-filing verification.\n\n\nOption D advocates for penalizing Smithers alone, suggesting she bore primary responsibility for providing inaccurate information.

            "Context": "Allegations ��likely to have evidentiary support . . .�� Rule 11(c)(3) includes two standards for factual assertions in a court filing. For ��regular�� factual allegations�those not ��specifically so identified���the pleader must have ��evidentiary support.�� But other allegations, if specifically identified in the pleading as made on information and belief, are proper if they are ��likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.�� This is an odd standard. Effectively, the pleader admits that she doesn�t have supporting evidence at the time of pleading, but sanguinely certifies that she expects to find some. Here again, the rule makers attempt to walk a thin line. They don�t want to allow groundless allegations made without evidentiary support. But they also don�t want to discourage parties from making allegations that may turn out to be true once the pleader has a full opportunity to develop her case. Often, information crucial to the plaintiff�s case can only be obtained from the defendant through discovery. Yet discovery comes after pleading, not before. So the system needs to build in some leeway for parties to make allegations they believe are valid and then to use the discovery tools to unearth supporting proof. Rule  11(b)(3)�s  ��likely-to-have-evidentiary-support-after-a- reasonable-opportunity . . .�� provision allows parties the flexibility to make such allegations, even if they don�t have evidence that would satisfy the first part of the standard for factual allegations. However, under Rule 11(b) a party may not continue to advocate a position once she has had a reasonable opportunity to develop the facts, if she hasn�t unearthed any evidentiary support for those allegations. She may make unsupported allegations at the outset, as long as she identifies them appropriately. And she may use the tools of discovery to dig for the proof.

Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent�s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that�s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court�s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry ��mea culpa!�� when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand�s Reasonable Person. Here�s an interesting question on the point.",

The rule provides, in the first sentence, that the defendant should put every defense that she has to a claim in her answer to the complaint.  However , if the defendant has certain objections to the case, she may raise them by a ��pre-answer motion�� before pleading, that is, before answering the complaint. If the defendant makes a pre-answer motion, it suspends the time for answering the complaint until the court addresses the objections raised in the motion. See Rule 12(a)(4)(A), (B). Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1  . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2  . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3  . improper venue; 4  . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5  . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6  . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7  . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff�s claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint. A crucial point about Rule 12 pre-answer motions is that the defendant  never has to make one . Making a pre-answer motion to assert these defenses is allowed, but not required. If the defendant prefers, she may raise any of these seven objections�or all of them�in her answer instead. I always snare a reasonable percentage of students on this basic point.

            "Context": "Rule 12(g): Limits on multiple pre-answer motions. The seven preliminary objections singled out in Rule 12(b) involve problems that might prevent the court from proceeding, or that need to be resolved at the outset of the case. Consequently, Rule 12 allows them to be raised immediately, and limits the defendant�s ability to raise them later if they are  not  raised in a pre-answer motion or in the answer. First, let�s consider what happens if the defendant  does  make a pre- answer motion, and leaves some objections out of it. Contrary to popular belief, Rule 12(g) does not provide that Rule 12(b) objections are waived if the defendant makes a pre-answer motion and leaves one out. All it says is that, if a party makes a pre-answer motion, and leaves out a preliminary objection that could have been included in the motion (was ��available�� to the moving party), the party can�t  make another pre- answer motion  based on the omitted objection. Rule 12(g)(2). For example, suppose that Cox moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3) for improper venue, and the judge denies the motion. Rule 12(g)(2) provides that he cannot file a second pre-answer motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(5) for insufficiency of service of process. Because he made a pre-answer motion based on one of these objections, and left out the insufficiency-of-service objection, Cox ��must not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection�� that was omitted from the first. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g). In other words, Cox, don�t harass the plaintiff with successive motions, each delaying the proceedings. If you have multiple Rule 12(b) objections, put them all in the first motion, so the judge can deal with them together. Note again that Rule 12(g)  doesn�t say that an omitted objection is waived . It only says that the defendant can�t make another pre-answer motion based on it. It is Rule 12(h) that does the dirty work. Rule 12(h) (1)(A) provides that four of these preliminary objections�personal jurisdiction, venue, sufficiency of process, and sufficiency of service of process�are waived if the defendant makes a pre-answer motion and leaves them out of the motion. I call these the ��four disfavored defenses,�� because the Rule pronounces them waived if they are not asserted in a timely manner. Failure to join a party under Rule 19, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction, however, are treated differently. Under Rule 12(g)(2), they may not be raised by a second pre-answer motion, if they were available and left out of the first. However, they may be asserted later in the litigation. Rule 12(h)(2).

            "Context": "Rule 12 and the notorious ��special appearance��. My students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That�s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant ��appears specially�� to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It�s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law�s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would ��appear specially�� to contest the court�s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a ��general appearance�� by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance  does not apply . But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn�t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court  has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal. Federal procedure applies once the case has been removed to federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1).",

Hue responds by filing an objection in the state court to personal jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived. The court will probably rule that Hue has",
            "Options": "Options: A.  waived the objection to personal jurisdiction, because he invoked the federal court�s jurisdiction by removing the case. B.  waived the objection to personal jurisdiction, because his state court response constituted a general appearance. C.  not waived the objection to personal jurisdiction, since under Federal Rule 12 it can be combined with other objections in an answer. D.  not waived the personal jurisdiction objection, because under Federal Rule 12(b) these two defenses may be asserted together in a pre-answer motion.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's analyze the given scenario where Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, and Hue files an objection to personal jurisdiction and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim five days later. He then removes the action to federal court and subsequently moves to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction. To do this, we'll examine each possible reason why waiver might occur as stated in options A through D.\n\n\nStep 3: Option A suggests that Hue waived the objection to personal jurisdiction because he invoked the federal court's jurisdiction by removing the case. However, invoking federal jurisdiction doesn't necessarily mean waiving all prior objections; instead, it means submitting to the federal court's authority regarding certain aspects of the case.\n\n\nStep 4: Next, consider option B, stating that Hue waived the objection to personal jurisdiction because his state court response constituted a general appearance. This seems plausible at first glance but remember that the special appearance doctrine primarily concerns when a defendant contests jurisdiction without otherwise participating in the litigation beyond what's necessary to challenge jurisdiction itself.\n\n\nStep 5: Moving forward, look at option C, suggesting that Hue hasn't waived the objection to personal jurisdiction since under Federal Rule 12, such objections can be combined with others in an answer. While true, this overlooks the fact that Hue initially made separate filings in state court before removal, potentially creating confusion about whether he'd already participated sufficiently to constitute a general appearance.\n\n\nStep 6: Finally, evaluate option D, indicating that Hue didn't waive the personal jurisdiction objection because under Federal Rule 12(b), these two defenses may be asserted together in a pre-answer motion. Given that Hue did remove the case and make subsequent filings in federal court, this option appears most consistent with applicable procedures and principles governing personal jurisdiction objections.\n\n\n---",

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's analyze what happens when Hue files his notice of removal ten days after being sued in state court. When Hue removes the case to federal court, he is essentially asking the federal court to take over the litigation that began in state court. At this point, the federal court looks at whether Hue complied with the requirements for removal, including giving proper notice to all parties involved. However, nothing in the process of removal itself addresses how Hue should proceed regarding his objections to personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 2: Next, consider what happens next - Hue filing his answer in the federal court. An answer typically responds to each allegation made against the defendant in the plaintiff's complaint. By doing so, Hue is addressing the substance of Goloupolos' claims but also includes objections to personal jurisdiction and insufficient pleading. This situation raises questions about whether Hue's inclusion of objections to personal jurisdiction within his answer might constitute a general appearance, thereby waiving his right to challenge the court's jurisdiction.\n\nStep 3: Now, recall that the question mentions that the state where the lawsuit originated follows the special appearance rule. Under this system, defendants cannot raise objections to personal jurisdiction unless they make a'special appearance,' which means arguing just the jurisdiction issue without touching anything else related to the dispute. Since Hue didn't follow this specific protocol by mentioning multiple points beyond mere jurisdiction in his initial filings, there seems to be confusion around whether he effectively waived his ability to argue personal jurisdiction.",

Before the deadline for submitting an answer in state court, Hue chose to remove the case to federal court. Following removal, Hue proceeded to submit an answer in federal court, addressing the merits of the complaint alongside raising objections to personal jurisdiction and insufficient pleading.\n\nStep 2: Given that Hue removed the case to federal court, it becomes pertinent to understand the interplay between state and federal procedural rules post-removal. While federal courts often retain the procedural posture established in state court, modifications may occur to align with federal practice.\n\nStep 3: To assess whether Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction, we must evaluate his actions relative to the waiver doctrine. Failure to raise an objection to personal jurisdiction promptly can indeed lead to forfeiture of that opportunity.\n\nStep 4: Considering the context of Hue's submission, specifically his combination of addressing the merits and raising jurisdiction-related objections, it appears that he aimed to tackle both aspects simultaneously. Nonetheless, this dual approach warrants scrutiny regarding potential waiver implications.\n\nStep 5: As part of evaluating Hue's position, recognize that federal Rule 12 plays a significant role in guiding the presentation of pre-answer motions to dismiss complaints. Understanding the specifics of this rule helps clarify Hue's obligations and potential consequences for non-compliance.\n\nStep 6: Reflecting further on Hue's strategy, acknowledge that separating his jurisdictional concerns from other arguments might serve as a viable method to avoid waiver. Clear demarcation between these topics could facilitate preservation of his objection to personal jurisdiction.\n\nStep 7: Taking into consideration the broader landscape of federal statutes and regulations influencing judicial decisions, appreciate how these external factors might shape interpretations of Hue's actions and outcomes.\n\nStep 8: Recognize that the waiver of Hue's objection to personal jurisdiction wouldn't necessarily mandate automatic dismissal of the entire case. Supplemental jurisdiction could potentially allow the court to continue processing remaining claims despite the loss of personal jurisdiction over Hue.\n\nStep 9: Acknowledge the possibility of invoking comity to obtain a more favorable assessment of Hue's procedural choices, particularly given the complexity arising from cross-jurisdictional contexts.\n\nStep 10: Finally, contemplate the prospect of exceptional circumstances leading to exceptions from typical waiver protocols, allowing Hue's situation to be treated uniquely.\n\n---",

            "Context": "Rule 26(b)(1): The scope of discovery. A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General . Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party�s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties� relative access to relevant information, the parties� resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ��any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.�� In an effort to rein in discovery, the ��relevant to the claim or defense of any party�� language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ��the subject matter of the pending action,�� but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ��proportionality factors�� in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ��relevant to a claim or defense in the action�� standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff�s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants� arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is  discoverable even though it isn�t admissible as evidence at a trial. ��Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.�� For example, statements that are ��hearsay,�� that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here�s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).",

Karim�s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such ��subsequent remedial measures�� is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff�s injury.

            "Context": "Rule 26(b)(1): The scope of discovery. A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General . Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party�s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties� relative access to relevant information, the parties� resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of ��any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.�� In an effort to rein in discovery, the ��relevant to the claim or defense of any party�� language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to ��the subject matter of the pending action,�� but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called ��proportionality factors�� in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the ��relevant to a claim or defense in the action�� standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff�s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants� arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is  discoverable even though it isn�t admissible as evidence at a trial. ��Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.�� For example, statements that are ��hearsay,�� that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties� pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to ��the subject matter of the action,�� rather than the ��claims or defenses�� raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.",
            "Question": "2. Issues and answers.  Apex Health Care, a health care corporation, terminates the admitting privileges of Sanchetti, a surgeon at Medway General Hospital. Sanchetti sues Apex in federal court, claiming that her privileges were terminated based on sex discrimination. She claims that she has been unable to find an equivalent position, and has lost income as a result of the termination. In its answer, Apex denies that it discriminated against Sanchetti, claiming that the termination was based on poor patient care instead. It also denies that she has lost income as a result of the dismissal. Which of the following is least likely to be subject to discovery under Rule 26(b)(1)?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Apex requests Sanchetti�s tax returns for the three years before and the three years since her termination. B.  Apex requests a copy of a letter Sanchetti sent to other staff doctors, complaining about medical staff salaries, and suggesting a job action to force improvements. C.  Sanchetti requests detailed information on the computer operating system and access methods for Apex�s files on patient treatment. D.  Sanchetti seeks the names and addresses of all doctors and nurses at Medway General who have been disciplined over the last seven years.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine which item is least likely to be subject to discovery under Rule 26(b)(1), we first examine the rule's requirements. According to Rule 26(b)(1), information is discoverable if it is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case.\n\nStep 2: We then analyze each option given in relation to the claims and defenses presented in the scenario between Apex Health Care and Sanchetti. Option A involves requesting Sanchetti's tax returns, which could potentially show loss of income due to the termination of her privileges. Therefore, it seems directly related to Sanchetti's claim of financial losses resulting from the alleged discriminatory act.\n\nStep 3: Next, looking at Option B, where Apex requests a letter written by Sanchetti to other staff members discussing salary concerns and potential job actions, this appears somewhat tangential to the main issue of gender discrimination versus poor patient care. While it does touch upon workplace dynamics, there doesn't appear to be a direct link to either side's primary argument unless it shows intent or bias towards certain groups, which still remains speculative without further context.\n\nStep 4: Moving on to Option C, Sanchetti's request for details on Apex's computer systems and file access methods pertains more broadly to understanding how data is managed and accessed within Apex, possibly shedding light on practices or policies affecting patient records. Given the nature of healthcare and electronic record-keeping, such information could indeed be relevant to ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations, thus indirectly supporting Sanchetti's claim.\n\nStep 5: Finally, examining Option D, seeking the names and addresses of all doctors and nurses disciplined at Medway General over the past seven years aligns closely with establishing patterns of behavior or systemic problems within the hospital environment. Such information could support both sides' positions—Apex arguing consistency in disciplinary measures regardless of gender, and Sanchetti pointing out disparities or biases in enforcement.\n\nStep 6: Considering the above points, Options A, C, and D all present clear connections to the core disputes between the parties. They deal directly with aspects of Sanchetti's employment status, Apex's management practices, or environmental conditions at Medway General that could influence perceptions of fairness or discrimination.\n\nStep 7: Among these options, however, Option B stands out because it touches on internal communications among staff members unrelated to the specific allegations of discrimination or poor performance. Without additional context showing how these letters relate to the central dispute, they seem less immediately pertinent compared to the others.",

            "Context": "The court�s role in limiting discovery: Relevance and burden. One problem with the relevance standard is that it is a matter of degree. ��The boundaries defining information that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action are necessarily vague and it is practically impossible to state a general rule by which they can be drawn.�� Wright & Miller �2008. Some information may be urgently relevant, some pretty relevant, and some marginally relevant, but still arguably useful in preparing a case. Without a bright-line test, there is a great deal of room for disagreement between the parties. For example, if an accident victim claims chronic back pain, his medical treatment by a back surgeon, or a chiropractor, is certainly relevant. His records of treatment by an internist probably are as well, since they may suggest other reasons for his condition. The defendant might seek discovery of the plaintiff�s psychiatric records as well, on the theory that the pain may be psychosomatic rather than a result of the accident. One could even make an argument for access to the plaintiff�s last five years of performance reviews at work, on the theory that job stress is the real source of his trouble. Relevance is not a yes/no proposition, but a slippery slope. Partly because of this ambiguity in the standard, Rule 26(b)(1) authorizes the court to restrict access to information even if it is relevant: Under the rule, discovery extends to relevant information ��unless otherwise limited by court order.�� Thus, the broad relevant-to-claims-or- defenses standard makes material  presumptively  discoverable, but the court has discretion to limit discovery for various reasons. For example, under the proportionality factors in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), the court may limit discovery because it is of marginal relevance, obtainable in another way, or if the burden of production outweighs the likely value of the information, in light of various practical realities about the case. And these bases for restricting discovery are not exhaustive. For example, the court may also restrict discovery of information that would be unduly intrusive on the privacy of a party, or that is sought for an improper purpose such as harassment of an opposing party. Because the relevance limit is vague, and cogent arguments can frequently be made for protecting relevant information from discovery, much is left to negotiation between counsel for the parties. If they cannot agree on the information to be produced, the party making the discovery request may move to compel production of the information, on the ground that she is entitled to it under the Rule. However, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) requires the moving party to certify that she has conferred with the objecting party, in an effort to resolve the discovery dispute without involving the court. Conversely, the party opposing production of information may take the initiative, by moving for a protective order under Rule 26(c), barring production of the disputed information. The judge presiding over the case will then have to decide what must be produced. If she orders production of the information, she may also impose conditions to protect confidentiality of information, to avoid intimidation, or to limit the burden of responding. Generally, the model is one of broad presumptive access to information, constrained (ideally) by the common sense of counsel, and discretionary limits imposed by the judge where they are not negotiated by the parties.",

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine which of the options is the least likely to be ordered by the court, we need to analyze each scenario according to the principles outlined above regarding relevance and burden.\n\nStep 2: Option A involves a personal injury claim related to a sexually transmitted disease. Here, the defendant's request for the names of the plaintiff's other sexual partners seems highly relevant given the nature of the alleged harm. While the plaintiff may resist due to concerns about privacy, courts often balance competing interests and allow disclosure of relevant evidence.\n\nStep 3: Moving to Option B, the plaintiff seeks discovery of the defendant's financial assets despite knowing he has only $10,000 in auto liability insurance. This request appears to be aimed at harassing the defendant financially rather than uncovering genuinely relevant information necessary for resolving the lawsuit. Courts generally disfavor requests intended solely to harass or intimidate opponents.\n\nStep 4: In Option C, the plaintiff wants to know the salaries of other managers at the defendant company to support her claim that she was fired unfairly compared to them. This information is directly relevant to understanding potential discriminatory practices within the company and thus falls squarely within the bounds of permissible discovery.\n\nStep 5: Turning to Option D, the plaintiff demands all reports from dealers concerning brake problems on specific models of vehicles manufactured by the defendant. Although this request covers a large number of vehicles and potentially extensive documentation, its relevance to determining product liability cannot be dismissed outright. Burden alone does not automatically justify denial; however, the extent of the burden needs consideration.\n\nStep 6: Finally, examining Option E, the plaintiff seeks all written complaints by prisoners asserting deprivations of rights of religious expression over a five-year period. Given the low stakes of the case ($1 in nominal damages plus injunctive relief), the breadth of the request raises significant questions about proportionality and undue burden.

            "Context": "Another limit: Objections based on privilege. Although discovery usually extends to all evidence relevant to claims and defenses in the action, Rule 26(b)(1) expressly carves out one limit on this: ��Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter. . . .�� Thus, a privilege bars production of information even though it is relevant to issues in the case. The term ��privilege�� in the context of litigation refers to information that is protected from disclosure under the rules of evidence. The decision to recognize a privilege represents a policy judgment that maintaining the confidentiality of certain communications is so important that society is willing to sacrifice the evidentiary value of those communications to preserve that confidentiality. There are lots of privileges out there, some recognized by all states, some by most, some by a few. 2  The best known are probably the attorney-client privilege and the constitutionally based privilege against self-incrimination. For a discussion of these and other privileges, such as the physician/patient privilege, priest/penitent privilege, psychotherapist privilege, and others more arcane, see  Moore�s Federal Practice  �26.49ff. If information is privileged, the party holding the privilege may refuse to testify about that communication, either in discovery or at a trial. The very meaning of privilege in this context is that the information need not be disclosed at all; obviously this purpose would be undermined if privileged information could be demanded through discovery. However, the existence of a privilege does not protect  factual information simply because it was communicated in a privileged conversation. ��The privilege only protects from disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicate with the attorney.��  Upjohn Co. v. United States , 449 U.S. 383, 395 (1981). Suppose, for example, that Mavroules admits to his priest in a counseling session that he feels guilty, because he knew his brakes were malfunctioning before a recent accident. If Mavroules were sued by the accident victim, and asked to answer an interrogatory concerning the condition of the brakes, he could not refuse to answer, even if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. The privilege protects the  communication itself.  Here, if Mavroules were asked whether he had told his priest that he knew his brakes were malfunctioning, he could refuse to answer if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. But the privilege does not protect facts about the litigation events themselves, simply because they were the subject of a privileged communication. If talking about the facts of a case in a privileged conversation would shield those facts from discovery, clients in litigation would be very forthcoming with their counsel: They would immediately tell their counsel everything about the case, bringing everything they know about the case within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Of course, this would eviscerate the discovery system. Nor is a privilege this broad necessary to serve the public policy goal of encouraging the protected communication. Protecting the communication itself suffices to further that policy. Thus, the privilege does not protect the underlying facts, or even the fact that a party has consulted counsel; only the content of the discussions between counsel and client is protected. Consider the application of the attorney-client privilege in the following troubling example.",
            "Question": "4. Confidential chat.  Shag, a budding rock star with no business experience, enters into a five-year exclusive contract with Fringe Records, after recording his first album with them. The album turns out to be a smash hit, and Big Money Records offers him a contract at fifteen times the paltry income called for by his contract with Fringe. Shag contacts Rivera, a lawyer, for advice. He asks Rivera if their discussion is confidential, and Rivera assures him that it is. Shag then explains the situation, and indicates that he plans to repudiate the Fringe contract, on the ground that Fringe had misrepresented the terms of the contract. Rivera asks what the misrepresentation was, and Shag admits that there wasn�t any. He admits that Jewell, Fringe�s vice president, told him that the agreement was binding for five years, but that he will testify that Jewell told him it was terminable by either party at will. Rivera advises him that the contract is binding, and that he will be liable for damages if he reneges on the Fringe contract. Shag does back out, signs with Big Money, and is sued by Fringe for damages, including punitive damages for deliberately repudiating the contract. Fringe sends interrogatories to Shag (now represented by new counsel) asking (1) whether he consulted a lawyer before repudiating the contract, (2) whether he ignored his lawyer�s advice when he repudiated the contract, and (3) whether Jewell told him, when he signed the Fringe contract, that it bound him to perform exclusively for Fringe for five years.",

Shag will have to answer the first interrogatory, but not the other two. C.  Shag will have to answer the first and second interrogatories, but not the third. D.  Shag will not have to answer any of the interrogatories, because all three were discussed in confidence with Rivera in the course of his representation. E.  None of the above is accurate.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we consider the nature of the questions posed by Fringe's interrogatories. Interrogatory number 1 seeks confirmation that Shag did consult a lawyer before repudiating the contract. This question pertains directly to the circumstances surrounding the alleged breach of contract and thus falls squarely within the realm of relevance. Therefore, Shag cannot avoid answering this question due to its direct connection to the dispute at hand.\n\n\nStep 2: Next, let us examine the second interrogatory, which queries whether Shag disregarded his lawyer’s advice when deciding to repudiate the contract. Similar to the first interrogatory, this inquiry also relates closely to the central issue of whether Shag acted intentionally in breaching the contract. Consequently, this line of questioning too should yield answers from Shag since it remains pertinent to the lawsuit.\n\n\nStep 3: Moving forward, we come across the third interrogatory, where Fringe requests details about conversations between Shag and Jewell pertaining specifically to the duration of the contract. Given our understanding of how the attorney-client privilege operates – protecting merely the substance of communications rather than the underlying facts – we find ourselves compelled to conclude that Shag indeed needs to respond to this query as well. After all, discussing the actual contents of the contract serves little purpose beyond revealing verifiable data related to the ongoing court proceedings.\n\n\n\nStep 4: In light of these considerations, we now arrive at the final determination regarding each of the given options presented in the problem statement. Based upon our prior conclusions, it becomes clear that none of the choices accurately capture the full extent of Shag’s obligations vis-à-vis responding to Fringe’s interrogatories.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Specifically, Option A suggests that Shag must provide responses to every single interrogatory without exception. While partially true, especially considering the initial two inquiries, this assertion overlooks the nuances associated with the third question.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Similarly, Options B and C both propose partial exemptions from providing testimony, yet neither fully accounts for the implications stemming from the attorney-client privilege.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Lastly, Option D posits that Shag enjoys blanket immunity from testifying altogether due solely to having engaged in confidential consultations with his attorney during the course of representing himself legally. As previously established however, mere invocation of the attorney-client privilege alone fails to safeguard sensitive information contained within otherwise innocuous statements made outside said privileged setting.\n\n\n\nStep 8: Taking all factors into consideration, we deduce that none of the aforementioned alternatives correctly encapsulates the precise requirements placed upon Shag relative to addressing Fringe’s set of interrogatories.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "Although discovery usually extends to all evidence relevant to claims and defenses in the action, Rule 26(b)(1) expressly carves out one limit on this: ��Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter. . . .�� Thus, a privilege bars production of information even though it is relevant to issues in the case. The term ��privilege�� in the context of litigation refers to information that is protected from disclosure under the rules of evidence. The decision to recognize a privilege represents a policy judgment that maintaining the confidentiality of certain communications is so important that society is willing to sacrifice the evidentiary value of those communications to preserve that confidentiality. There are lots of privileges out there, some recognized by all states, some by most, some by a few. 2  The best known are probably the attorney-client privilege and the constitutionally based privilege against self-incrimination. For a discussion of these and other privileges, such as the physician/patient privilege, priest/penitent privilege, psychotherapist privilege, and others more arcane, see  Moore�s Federal Practice  �26.49ff. If information is privileged, the party holding the privilege may refuse to testify about that communication, either in discovery or at a trial. The very meaning of privilege in this context is that the information need not be disclosed at all; obviously this purpose would be undermined if privileged information could be demanded through discovery. However, the existence of a privilege does not protect  factual information simply because it was communicated in a privileged conversation. ��The privilege only protects from disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicate with the attorney.��  Upjohn Co. v. United States , 449 U.S. 383, 395 (1981). Suppose, for example, that Mavroules admits to his priest in a counseling session that he feels guilty, because he knew his brakes were malfunctioning before a recent accident. If Mavroules were sued by the accident victim, and asked to answer an interrogatory concerning the condition of the brakes, he could not refuse to answer, even if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. The privilege protects the  communication itself.  Here, if Mavroules were asked whether he had told his priest that he knew his brakes were malfunctioning, he could refuse to answer if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. But the privilege does not protect facts about the litigation events themselves, simply because they were the subject of a privileged communication. If talking about the facts of a case in a privileged conversation would shield those facts from discovery, clients in litigation would be very forthcoming with their counsel: They would immediately tell their counsel everything about the case, bringing everything they know about the case within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Of course, this would eviscerate the discovery system. Nor is a privilege this broad necessary to serve the public policy goal of encouraging the protected communication. Protecting the communication itself suffices to further that policy. Thus, the privilege does not protect the underlying facts, or even the fact that a party has consulted counsel; only the content of the discussions between counsel and client is protected. Administering discovery objections based on privilege can be problematic. The very point of the privilege is to protect the communication from revelation. Yet how can a requesting party evaluate claims that an item is privileged without knowing the content of the document or conversation? Rule 26(b)(5) attempts to deal with this problem by requiring parties who object to production of information based on privilege to provide enough detail about the protected material to allow the requesting party to evaluate the privilege objection. The party claiming a privilege must (1) expressly make the claim; and (2) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed�and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(A). This provision is meant to facilitate assessment of claims of privilege, by requiring the objecting party to provide sufficient information to allow the requesting party to determine whether a privilege applies to it, or at least whether the issue is sufficiently doubtful to justify moving to compel production of the information. If the applicability of the privilege is challenged, the court can decide whether it is privileged based on the information required under Rule 26(b)(5)(A). In doubtful cases, the court can review documents in camera (privately, rather than in open court) to determine whether the privilege applies. If it does not, of course, discovery will be ordered. Consider the appropriate response to the requested discovery in the following question.",

Sanders sends a Request for Production of Documents under Rule 34 to Loman. Its Third Request demands production of ��all notes, documents, memoranda or other records, in whatever form, relevant to the negotiations between the parties relating to the plaintiff�s entitlement to commissions under the contract.�� Loman does not want to produce the memo describing his meeting with Sanders�s president.

            "Context": "The meaning of ��work product�� When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of ��work product,�� or ��trial preparation materials.�� However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client�s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client�s files were relevant to the opposing party�s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers� practices, since they could reveal counsel�s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In  Hickman v. Taylor , 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such ��attorney work product�� should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers� ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel�s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled ��Trial Preparation: Materials�� was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman  provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be ��documents or tangible things.�� They must be ��prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,�� and they must be prepared ��by or for another party or its representative. . . .�� If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer�s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are ��documents or tangible things,�� and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not ��prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.�� They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has ��substantial need for the materials to prepare its case�� and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal ��the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party�s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.�� Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is ��yes,�� the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is ��yes,�� it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the ��work product doctrine,�� or the ��protection for trial preparation material,�� rather than as a privilege.

So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer’s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are “documents or tangible things,” and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not “prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.” They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b)(3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances.

            "final_answer": "gal Context\nThe meaning of 'work product' When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of 'work product,' or 'trial preparation materials.' However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client’s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client’s files were relevant to the opposing party’s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers’ practices, since they could reveal counsel’s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In  Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such ‘attorney work product’ should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers’ ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel’s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled “Trial Preparation: Materials” was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman  provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be “documents or tangible things.” They must be “prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,” and they must be prepared “by or for another party or its representative…. ” If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A).

For example, in  Hickman , opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh�s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a ��document or tangible thing.�� It isn�t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product�that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh�s recollections of witness interviews�are  not  protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the  Hickman  case itself.

At the outset of the deposition, DeMarco asks Sanchez whether the company�s lawyers, in preparing him for his deposition, had noted any particularly problematic issues they expected to come up at the deposition, and what areas of inquiry they had spent most of their time discussing.

D.  sustained under  Hickman v. Taylor , even if Rule 26(b)(3) does not apply and Sorenson demonstrates a substantial need for the information. E.  overruled, since Rule 26(b)(3) does not protect the information from discovery.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: In order to determine which option is correct, we first examine the facts presented in the problem. Sorenson sues Marathon Corporation in federal court seeking compensation for services rendered as a broker. During the course of litigation, DeMarco, Sorenson's counsel, conducts a deposition of Sanchez, an independent accountant who was involved in the negotiation and audit process related to the transaction between Marathon and the family business.\n\nStep 2: As part of the deposition, DeMarco questions Sanchez about discussions he had with Marathon's attorneys regarding potential topics of inquiry during the deposition. This includes asking if there were specific issues identified by Marathon's lawyers that could arise during questioning and how much time those lawyers devoted to certain subjects.\n\nStep 3: Marathon's counsel raises two objections - one based on the work product doctrine and another grounded in the attorney-client privilege. We'll analyze each separately but initially focus on understanding the nature of the requested information and its relevance to the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nStep 4: To decide the issue, let's break down the key concepts involved here. First, we're dealing with the scope of discovery rules within civil procedure, specifically focusing on Rule 26(b)(3) concerning work product protections. Additionally, we touch upon the attorney-client privilege, which shields confidential communications between clients and their legal advisors.\n\nStep 5: Given the specifics of the scenario, where Marathon's counsel is being asked about conversations with their own attorneys regarding strategy for defending against Sanchez's testimony, we recognize that such internal deliberations typically fall under both the attorney-client privilege and potentially the work product doctrine.\n\nStep 6: Now considering the options given, we evaluate them against our understanding of applicable law principles. Option A suggests sustaining the objection due to the attorney-client privilege alone; however, without further details on the content of the privileged communication, we lean towards examining broader implications including work product considerations.\n\nStep 7: Options B and C suggest application of Rule 26(b)(3) directly or indirectly, implying that the materials discussed are indeed covered under work product protections. While true that work product generally enjoys broad protection, determining whether these particular inquiries qualify remains crucial.\n\nStep 8: Finally, evaluating option D, which references  Hickman v. Taylor, indicates consideration beyond mere applicability of current procedural rules. Since  Hickman  sets forth foundational principles protecting attorney thought processes and strategies, applying its rationale broadly supports shielding sensitive client-attorney interactions from scrutiny.\n\n---",

Specifically, the scenario involves Marathon's counsel attempting to shield discussions with their attorneys regarding strategy for defending against Sanchez's testimony.\n\n\nIn analyzing this situation, several factors become pertinent:\n\n\nFirstly, the attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between clients and their legal advisors. This includes discussions about legal strategy, opinions, and advice exchanged between the lawyer and client.\n\n\nSecondly, the work product doctrine safeguards materials prepared by parties in anticipation of litigation, including memoranda, analyses, and other written items created by either the litigant or her attorney(s).\n\n\nConsidering these principles, when Marathon's counsel invokes both the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine to prevent disclosure of their discussions with Sanchez, we must carefully assess the extent to which each doctrine applies.\n\n\nOption D correctly identifies that even if Rule 26(b)(3) does not explicitly apply and Sorenson demonstrates a substantial need for the information, the principles outlined in  Hickman v. Taylor  still support shielding sensitive client-attorney interactions from scrutiny.\n\n\nThis approach acknowledges that while the attorney-client privilege provides direct protection for confidential communications, the broader framework set forth in  Hickman  ensures that attorney thought processes and strategies remain safeguarded from unnecessary disclosure.\n\n\nTherefore, acknowledging the comprehensive coverage offered by  Hickman  underscores the appropriateness of invoking its protective principles alongside the attorney-client privilege.\n\n\nThus, the reasoning leading to the selection of Option D emphasizes the continued relevance of  Hickman's foundational principles in safeguarding attorney-counselor relationships and maintaining confidentiality in the face of discovery requests.\n\n\n---",

Therefore, New Era's options for obtaining the letter depend upon how courts interpret the scope of Rule 26(e)'s duty to supplement prior responses when new information becomes known.\n\n\nStep 3: Courts generally hold that a party must supplement its prior responses whenever it obtains information that indicates its prior response was incomplete or incorrect.

            "updated_reasoning": "---\n# Legal Context\n## Automatic disclosure under the Federal Rules\nMost discovery is initiated by counsel for the litigants, who send interrogatories and requests for production of documents to opposing parties and schedule depositions of witnesses. However, Rule 26(a) also requires “automatic disclosure” of certain categories of information—that is, an exchange of this information among the parties without a request for it from another party. Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1)); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases 1  are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose – the identity of individuals “likely to have discoverable information”–along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses—“copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information)” and “things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses”—“a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based”—and “any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action.” The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f). Until this meeting takes place, the parties are barred from taking discovery by other means (such as interrogatories, requests for documents, or depositions). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information  that the disclosing party may use  to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness’s testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness’s testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party “may use to support its claims or defenses.” Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal  supporting  evidence, but not adverse evidence. This avoids placing counsel in the position of having to review all known evidence, locate all documents that might support the  other party’s  case, and hand them over without a request. In some cases, Rule 26(a)(1) may call for disclosure of a document as to which a party claims a privilege or that constitutes work product. Rule 26(a) does not expressly authorize a disclosing party to object to disclosure based on the attorney-client privilege or work product protection. What should a party do if she has information subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) but arguably subject to such protection? In analyzing the question below, consider Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) and Rule 26(b)(5)(A). The latter requires a party who objects to discovery based on a “privilege or protection” to “describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed—and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.”\n\n## Question\nDisclosure and protection.

While disclosure was added to the discovery rules in 1993, interrogatories, depositions, and requests for production of documents have been available under the Federal Rules since their adoption in 1938. Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party�s lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify ��each act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.�� This is not a purely factual question, like ��Please state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.�� Instead, such ��contention interrogatories�� call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings.

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: In this problem, we're dealing with interrogatories - a tool used during the discovery phase of litigation to gather information from the opposing side. We need to determine whether Arena's response to Shukla's interrogatory regarding liability is adequate.\n\n\nStep 2: To assess the adequacy of Arena's response, let's examine each option given:\n\n\nOption A suggests that Arena's response is proper. However, we'll evaluate if this aligns with the requirements of the rule governing interrogatories.\n\n\nOption B proposes that Arena's response isn't proper due to its lack of specificity about the particular negligent act committed by Shukla. Let's consider if this is indeed a requirement for responses to interrogatories.\n\n\nOption C argues that Arena's response falls short because it doesn't explicitly mention the underlying facts supporting the claim of liability. Is this omission sufficient grounds for considering the response inadequate?\n\n\nOption D posits that Arena's response is unnecessary. Given the nature of the interrogatory, we'll explore whether providing additional details beyond what's already stated would add value to the inquiry.\n\n\nStep 3: Now, examining Option A, we see that it states Arena's response is proper. According to Rule 33(c), an appropriate response to an interrogatory requires either a direct answer to the question asked or a statement indicating why the requested information cannot be furnished without undue burden or privilege. Since Arena directly addresses the issue raised by Shukla's interrogatory, stating the reason he believes Shukla is liable, this seems to meet the standard outlined in the rule.\n\n\nStep 4: Moving on to Option B, it claims that Arena's response lacks specificity regarding the exact negligent act attributed to Shukla. Although interrogatories aim to elicit clear and concise information, there's no explicit requirement within Rule 33 that every response include detailed descriptions of all related acts or circumstances. Therefore, this argument appears less convincing than others presented here.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Next up is Option C, suggesting that Arena's response inadequately provides the underlying facts supporting his assertion of liability against Shukla. As per our earlier examination of Rule 33(c), when faced with an interrogatory asking for reasons behind a contention, the respondent typically needs to offer explanations grounded in evidence rather than mere assertions. By failing to supply concrete evidence substantiating his stance, Arena's reply could indeed fall short according to these standards.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Lastly, looking at Option D, proposing that Arena's response is superfluous, we find ourselves questioning how much extra detail truly adds significant insight into matters already covered through existing statements made throughout proceedings thus far.\n\n\n\n---",

His explanation leans heavily towards a narrative justification rather than presenting verifiable evidence backing his claim.\n\nStep 3: Assessing Specificity Regarding Negligent Act\nWhile Arena mentions that Shukla operated his vehicle negligently, resulting in the collision, he does not elaborate on the specific action(s) considered negligent. This lack of clarity raises concerns about the sufficiency of his response under the rule.\n\nStep 4: Considering Implications of Prior Statements\nIn light of the existing body of statements made throughout the proceeding, Arena's failure to incorporate additional details in his response to Shukla's interrogatory might seem redundant.

Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. The general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients� interests. But in one respect they can be more effective than depositions. An interrogatory to a corporate party requires the party ��to furnish such information as is  available to the party, �� (emphasis added) not just information that the person answering them personally knows. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5). This emphasizes that it is the lawyers who interpose legal objections to discovery (and, consequently, may be sanctioned if such objections are not justified). Which is the proper response to the interrogatory below?",

General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation.

B.  respond by listing whatever documents she has in her own files about accidents involving the engine.

D.  not respond to the interrogatory, since it is not sent by an opposing party.",

Since the information sought includes documents held across various office locations, the key phrase here is 'available to the party.'\n\nStep 3: Given that the information is scattered among different offices, the critical issue becomes whether General Engines needs to investigate further to gather the necessary data before providing the responses.\n\nStep 4: Considering these points, let's evaluate each given option.\n\n\nOption A suggests that General Engines' representative, Branch, should conduct an investigation to find out what relevant documents exist within the company. This aligns perfectly with the requirement stated in Rule 33(b)(1)(B).\n\nOption B proposes that Branch responds using only the documents found in her own files. This would fall short of fulfilling the obligation outlined in the rule, as it doesn't account for potentially crucial information stored elsewhere within the organization.\n\nOption C mentions objecting due to the requirements specified in Rule 26(a)(1)(B), which deals with initial disclosures rather than interrogatories specifically asking for document lists after the fact.\n\nOption D advises ignoring the request altogether, claiming it wasn't submitted by an opposing party - however, there isn't anything in the text suggesting that the sender status affects the duty to comply with the rule.\n\n\n\nTherefore, considering our findings above, Option A stands out as the most appropriate course of action according to the applicable rule.",

The request must describe the categories of documents sought with ��reasonable particularity.�� Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(1)(A). A request for ��all documents relevant to the plaintiff�s claims against the defendant�� would be too broad, but it is permissible to describe the requested documents by category (Rule 34(b)(1)(A)), such as ��all documents relevant to the plaintiff�s medical treatment from the date of the accident to the date of this request.�� Requests for production require a party to open its files, to provide other parties access to documents that are otherwise confidential and may be damaging to the producing party�s case. It is indeed intrusive. It isn�t surprising that parties�especially corporations with extensive operations and complex filing and computer systems�frequently view such discovery as unwarranted. It can be extremely burdensome to comply with even a narrowly crafted request for production, and may interfere significantly with corporate operations. Rule 34 provides one means of limiting this burden. Rule 34(b)(1)(E) (i) authorizes a party to comply with a Rule 34 request by producing the relevant documents as kept in the usual course of business. Thus, a corporation could simply make its files available to the requesting party, and let the requesting party do the work of culling through them for relevant documents. This course has several problems, however.  First , it provides the other party with wide access to files, both relevant and irrelevant. There is likely to be information in the files that the producing party would prefer to keep confidential, and that would not be within the scope of the Rule 34 request.  Second , allowing access to the files waives the producing party�s objection to production of documents that are protected from discovery. For example, allowing the other side to review files that contain documents that are privileged or enjoy work product protection will waive the privilege or protection. Nor would opening the files to the other side save the responding party much effort. The responding party will have to review those files anyway, in order to prepare for trial and to determine what documents the other side has found. Consequently, when a request is made, the producing party is likely to take the alternative course available under Rule 34: to cull through its files, extract relevant documents, ��organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the request,�� (Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(E)(i)) and produce them for the requesting party. Consider how the producing party should respond to the request for production of documents in the following question.",
            "Question": "6. A matter of opinion.  Paragon Corporation is involved in litigation with Omniplex Corporation, which alleges that Paragon breached its contract to supply Omniplex with wiring assemblies for its high-speed printing presses. In particular, the parties dispute the meaning of a clause that requires Paragon to ��supply Omniplex�s needs for wiring assemblies for the period of the contract.�� Omniplex argues that this requires Paragon to supply as many assemblies as Omniplex requires. Paragon argues that it only requires them to supply the number Omniplex was using yearly when the contract was made. Paragon receives a Request for Production of Documents under Rule 34 seeking ��all documents relating to the drafting, negotiation, or execution of the contract in issue in this litigation.�� At its counsel�s request, Paragon officers order a search of the files for documents responsive to the request. They come up with quite a few. One, however, is particularly troubling. It is a memo written by Paragon�s contracts administrator, detailing her discussions with Omniplex negotiators. The memo questions whether Paragon should accept this provision, since ��I read this language in the agreement to commit Paragon to supplying  all  of Omniplex�s requirements for wiring assemblies for five years, regardless of conditions in the market or alternative opportunities with other customers.��",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Paragon will have to produce the document in response to the request. B.  Paragon should describe the document as required by Rule 26(b)(5), but raise the work product objection to avoid producing it. C.  Paragon should interpret the Rule 34 request narrowly, and not produce the document. D.  Paragon need not produce the document, because it simply states an opinion as to the meaning of the disputed term in the contract. E.  Paragon should not produce the document, since it would be very damaging to its case.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To begin answering this problem, we first note that the document at issue appears to be a draft memorandum prepared during negotiations over the terms of the contract between Paragon and Omniplex. \n\nStep 2: As stated above, the request seeks �all documents relating to the drafting, negotiation, or execution of the contract.� Since the memo falls squarely within these categories, it seems clear that the document is discoverable unless some exception applies.\n\nStep 3: We now consider each possible answer choice to see if there might be an applicable exception.\n\n\nOption A suggests that Paragon must turn over the document. While true that the document is arguably within the scope of the request, this ignores potential exceptions that might apply.\n\n\n\nOption B proposes describing the document according to Rule 26(b)(5) and raising a work-product objection. However, the memo does not appear to qualify as work product; rather, it reflects communications about the proposed contract terms.\n\n\n\nOption C advises interpreting the request narrowly and excluding the document. But given the breadth of the request, it's unlikely that courts would uphold such a narrow interpretation.\n\n\n\nOption D posits that the document merely expresses an opinion regarding the contract's meaning. Although opinions themselves aren't typically considered discoverable, they're often intertwined with facts and evidence supporting their validity. Here, though, the memo doesn't seem to present factual support for its argument - instead, it raises concerns about contractual obligations.\n\n\n\nFinally, Option E asserts that the document shouldn't be produced due to its potentially damaging impact on Paragon's case. Yet, this rationale relies more on strategic considerations than legitimate grounds for withholding discovery.\n\n\n\nConsidering these points, none of Options A-E directly address why the document wouldn't fall within the scope of the request. Therefore, without further justification beyond mere assertion, no option stands out as obviously incorrect.\n\n\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, we find that the key lies in understanding what constitutes 'work product.' Work product encompasses materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, including memoranda analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of a client's position.\n\n\n\nGiven our earlier observation that the memo discusses potential issues related to contractual commitments, it becomes apparent that this communication qualifies as work product.\n\n\n\nTherefore, despite being part of the broader category described in the request, the specific nature of the document renders it exempt from disclosure under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(b)(4).\n\n\n\nHence, the appropriate action involves identifying the exemption and invoking it appropriately.\n\n\n\nThe best approach here is thus to invoke the work-product doctrine explicitly.\n\n\n\nSo, the proper way forward is to identify the document as falling within the description in the request but then assert the work-product objection.\n\n\n\nThis aligns perfectly with Option B.\n\n\n\nThus, after careful consideration, the logical path leads us to conclude that:",

            "Context": "Problems posed by electronic discovery In large scale litigation these days, many problems are posed by the fact that the ��documents�� parties need are in electronic form. ��It is estimated that over 90 percent of all business information is created electronically and never printed out.�� 4  Computers have facilitated the creation, storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information. When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: � Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that ��electronically stored information�� is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it�s clear now that it is. � Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is ��not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.�� The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. � Rule 37�which addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in  discovery�expressly  addresses  failure  to  preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders� such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator�s claim. � Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an ��inadvertent disclosure�� to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party�s claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision.",

The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness�s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They ��get the witness on the record.�� That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness�s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the  other side�s  witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness�s testimony or counsel�s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent�s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party�s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness�s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial.

            "Context": "Instructions not to answer at a deposition While depositions produce sworn testimony, they are not taken in front of a judge. They are usually taken in the office of the lawyer taking the deposition. A court reporter, hired privately by deposing counsel, swears the witness and records the testimony. The testimony is then transcribed and provided to counsel for each party. Counsel for all parties are entitled to attend the deposition, and usually do. An interesting problem arises if the deponent�s lawyer has objections to the deposing counsel�s questions. Since there�s no judge present to rule on objections, what happens? Several provisions of Rule 30 address this problem. Rule 30(c)(2) provides: An objection at the time of the examination�whether to evidence, to a party�s conduct, to the officer�s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition�must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. That rule further provides that ��A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).�� Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted ��in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.�� Under these provisions, the deponent�s counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (��the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection���Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the  use of evidence at trial , not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained.

            "Context": "A. The meaning of ��failure to state a claim��. It makes sense that a party should not be able to take a case to trial if she seeks relief that a court is not able to grant. Suppose, for example, that Arkwright, owner of a car dealership, sues Miranda for negligence. He claims that Miranda caused an accident on Main Street, that because of the accident traffic was unable to reach his dealership for three hours during his President�s Day sale, and as a result he lost profits. Many states limit recovery in negligence cases to direct personal injury or property damage, and would not recognize a right to recover for secondary economic damages like Arkwright�s. See generally D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, and E. Bublick,  The Law of Torts  (2d ed.) �611. In these states, a court looking at Arkwright�s complaint could tell that he seeks relief that is not available under the law. Since there is no right to relief, even if Arkwright proves all the facts he has alleged, the court would dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is to test the legal validity of the plaintiff�s allegations, not their factual truth. Consequently, in considering the motion, the court does not ask whether the plaintiff is likely to prove them. The motion does not challenge the plaintiff�s ability to prove her case�as a summary judgment motion does�but only the validity of the legal cause of action she asserts. In ruling on the motion, the court must assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true.

Under the impact rule a plaintiff can only recover for emotional distress if she actually suffered a physical impact in the accident caused by the defendant. Mere ��bystanders�� cannot recover. Snow was not in his parents� car at the time of the accident. He was waving goodbye to them from the curb, where they had just dropped him off. He claims, however, that Petrillo�s car, when it careened into his parents� car, threw water on his leg, and that this satisfies the impact rule. Petrillo denies that his car threw water on Snow. He also denies that water splashing is sufficient to satisfy the impact rule under Euphoria law; the impact, Petrillo argues, must be with the defendant�s car itself.

It isn�t usually that hard to allege a valid cause of action. But it is one thing to  allege  the required elements and quite another to prove that they are true. Frequently, the defendant will doubt that the plaintiff can prove all of the elements of her complaint, and wish to challenge her ability to do so before trial. The motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 provides a mechanism for doing so, and for disposing of cases if that challenge demonstrates that the plaintiff has no proof of a required element. 1 Suppose, for example, that Fuentes, the beneficiary on Carello�s life insurance policy, seeks to recover the proceeds of the policy from Reliable Insurance Company. Reliable refuses to pay, arguing that Carello committed suicide; the insurance company would not be liable on the policy if he did. Fuentes sues, alleging that Carello owned the policy, that she was the beneficiary, that Carello died accidentally, and Reliable has breached the contract by failing to pay the proceeds. These allegations state a good claim for breach of contract. If Fuentes proves them, she would be entitled to recover. But suppose that Reliable had good reason to refuse to pay. Reliable investigators had interviewed a witness, Herrera, who will testify that Carello, who was seriously ill, had deliberately jumped from a seventh- story window. Convinced that Fuentes cannot prove an essential element of her claim�that Carello died accidentally�it moves for summary judgment, attaching Herrera�s affidavit swearing that Carello deliberately jumped. Reliable�s motion, supported by admissible evidence (sworn eyewitness testimony) challenges Fuentes�s ability to prove an element of her case. It says to the court, ��Fuentes may have alleged accidental death, but she can�t prove that allegation. Our evidence shows that Carello did not die accidentally, so Fuentes cannot recover under the policy. Consequently, there is no dispute of fact about how he died, and we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).�� This sounds pretty convincing, doesn�t it? There�s no need to convene a jury and try the case if there�s nothing to try, and Reliable has argued that there really isn�t anything to try, because there is ��no genuine dispute�� of material fact about how Carello died.

If the movant fails to provide sufficient evidence, the court cannot find in favor of them.\n\nStep 3: Opponent's Obligation\nOn the other hand, the non-movant (the person against whom the motion is brought) must present evidence demonstrating that there is a genuine dispute over material facts. However, if the non-movant does not meet this obligation, the court shall render summary judgment if the movant is entitled to it.\n\nStep 4: Analysis of Given Facts\nIn this scenario, Reliable Insurance Company moves for summary judgment claiming that Carello, the insured, took his own life using an overdose of sleeping pills. They attach an affidavit stating that Carello expressed suicidal thoughts just prior to his death. Since Fuentes did not file any counter-affidavit or evidence contradicting these assertions, we need to determine what happens next.\n\n\nStep 5: Legal Implications\nAccording to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56(c), when a party fails to properly address another party’s assertion of fact made under oath, the court “may” consider that omission as consent to judicial notice of the truth of the averment.” Therefore, since Fuentes didn’t oppose Reliable’s motion with countering evidence, the Court could take Reliable’s statement at face value.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Conclusion Based On Previous Steps And Relevant Premises\n\nSince Reliable submitted evidence which, if taken as true, establishes their defense, and Fuentes failed to offer any conflicting evidence, the court should grant the motion for summary judgment.",

            "Context": "Mixed motions: Rule 12(b)(6) and the ��speaking motion�� In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, the court only considers the complaint itself, to determine whether, if the allegations in the complaint are proved, the plaintiff would be entitled to some form of relief. Clear though that proposition may be, litigants frequently disregard it �sometimes consciously, sometimes mistakenly�in filing Rule 12(b) (6) motions. It is very common for defendants to use the Rule 12(b)(6) motion not to challenge whether the plaintiff has  pleaded  a compensable claim�the intended role of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion�but rather to challenge her ability to  prove  her case. To do that, they frequently submit evidence with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to show that she can�t prove a necessary element of her claim. For example, suppose that Van Dam, a sailor, sues Jimenez, owner of a ship, under a federal statute authorizing recovery from the owner for injuries at sea. In the complaint, he alleges that his injuries took place at sea. Jimenez, however, has evidence that Van Dam�s injury took place on the dock before sailing, which would not be compensable under the statute. So he moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that the complaint ��fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,�� because the injury took place on land, not at sea. And he attaches to the motion affidavits from witnesses stating that the injury took place before the ship sailed. Although Jimenez�s motion isn�t strictly proper�it confuses the role of Rule 12 with that of Rule 56�motions like it are filed so often that Rule 12 acknowledges the practice and instructs the court how to deal with such ��speaking motions�� (so called because they go beyond a legal challenge to introduce factual evidence outside of the complaint). If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Under this provision, if the defendant has in effect moved for summary judgment, by submitting  evidence  about the truth of the allegations, rather than challenging their legal sufficiency, the court can convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment and treat it accordingly. The judge will consider the motion not under the Rule 12(b) (6) standard, but the Rule 56 ��no-genuine-dispute-of-material-fact�� standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and both parties will be given an opportunity to submit admissible evidence relevant to the disputed allegation. The defendant isn�t really getting away with something by this less than rigorous use of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Rule 56(b) provides that a defending party can move for summary judgment at any time until after the close of discovery, so the court is just treating the motion as the summary judgment motion the defendant could have filed anyway. With this background, the example should be pretty straightforward.",

            "Context": "The function of the directed verdict motion (judgment as a matter of law before verdict) The purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (motion should be granted where there is ��no legally sufficient evidentiary basis�� for the jury to find for the party opposing the motion). In a case where the plaintiff�s proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by ��directing a verdict�� against her. This older name, ��directed verdict,�� is suggestive of the motion�s purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally ��direct the verdict,�� that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn�t get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff�s verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by ��finding the facts.�� However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure �2522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor.  First , she bears the burden to convince the judge  that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the ��burden of production.�� To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her  second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally  could  find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it  will  find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury�s job is to determine whether she has met the ��burden of proof�� on each element of her claim, while the judge�s role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant�s motion in the following example. It�s a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant�s breach of the duty of due care caused her damages.",

If she has, the jury gets the case; if she hasn�t, the judge may order entry of judgment for the defendant. Still, it looks perilously like the judge is finding facts herself, by restraining the jury�s ability to do so where the evidence is weak. Isn�t the conclusion that the evidence is ��too weak to support a verdict�� for the plaintiff a subjective judgment by the judge on the facts themselves? Well, it is somewhat subjective. It�s hard to dispute that the judge does, in some degree, pass upon the strength of the plaintiff�s case, unless it�s a case like that in  Question 1 , where there was literally  no evidence on a required element. But the cases at least establish some guidelines to constrain the judge in making the too-weak-for-a-jury determination.  First , the judge isn�t to direct a verdict because she thinks the defendant�s proof (on one or more of the elements of the claim) is stronger than the plaintiff�s. That would be substituting her judgment about the facts for the jury�s. She�s not supposed to do that; she�s supposed to decide whether a jury could rationally reach a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence before it. Second , in deciding whether to direct a verdict, the judge does not decide for herself whether the witnesses are telling the truth. Except where testimony is literally incredible, she must assume that the jury will construe the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party. The standard is ��whether the evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable [persons] could have reached.��  Simblest v. Maynard , 427 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1970). The judge must assume that the jury will believe the plaintiff�s witnesses, even if their testimony is impeached or contradicted by the defendant�s. It�s up to the jury to decide whom to believe, not the judge, so legitimate conflicts in the testimony about who ran the red light should go to the jury.  Third , if certain testimony would support two inferences, one that supports recovery and one that doesn�t, it is the jury�s job to decide which inference to make. The judge, in passing on the motion, must assume that the jury will make the inference that favors the plaintiff. In other words, she is supposed to take the case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, assume that the jury will resolve conflicts in the testimony in the plaintiff�s favor, and ask,  if it does , would there be adequate evidence to support a plaintiff�s verdict.

That would be substituting her judgment about the facts for the jury’s. She’s not supposed to do that; she’s supposed to decide whether a jury could rationally reach a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence before it. Second, in deciding whether to direct a verdict, the judge does not decide for herself whether the witnesses are telling the truth. Except where testimony is literally incredible, she must assume that the jury will construe the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party. The standard is “whether the evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable [people] could have reached.” Simblest v. Maynard, 427 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1970). The judge must assume that the jury will believe the plaintiff’s witnesses, even if their testimony is impeached or contradicted by the defendant’s. It’s up to the jury to decide whom to believe, not the judge, so legitimate conflicts in the testimony about who ran the red light should go to the jury. Third, if certain testimony would support two inferences, one that supports recovery and one that doesn’t, it is the jury’s job to decide which inference to make. The judge, in passing on the motion, must assume that the jury will make the inference that favors the plaintiff. In other words, she is supposed to take the case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, assume that the jury will resolve conflicts in the testimony in the plaintiff’s favor, and ask, if it does, would there be adequate evidence to support a plaintiff’s verdict. Here’s a question (based on facts shamelessly cribbed from another source)2 that illustrates the application of these guidelines.3. Found facts? Pavarotti sues Sills for negligence, after he is hit by a car on Maple Street. The driver did not stop after the accident. At trial, Pavarotti presents the testimony of a bystander that the car was a red Chevrolet, that two of the numbers on the license plate were “3” and “1,” and that the driver was a blonde woman. He further presents evidence that Sills, a blonde woman, lives three blocks from the scene of the accident, owns a red Chevrolet with license plate number 74J-311, and often commutes home along Maple Street in the early evening. Sills testifies that she was home cooking dinner at the time of the accident, and her car was in her garage. This is the entire evidence on the issue of whether Sills was the driver of the car that hit Pavarotti. At the close of the evidence, Sills moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a), arguing that the evidence is insufficient to establish that it was her car that hit Pavarotti.Options: A. The judge should grant the motion only if she concludes that Sills is telling the truth. B. The judge should grant the motion for Sills. She has given direct testimony that it was not her that hit Pavarotti, and Pavarotti’s evidence that it was is based on inferences from circumstantial evidence. C.

            "Context": "The meaning of a ��legally insufficient evidentiary basis�� So, we�ve established that one of the judge�s roles is to make sure that the plaintiff has presented enough evidence on each element of her claim that a jury could reason to a rational verdict for her on each element. If she has, the jury gets the case; if she hasn�t, the judge may order entry of judgment for the defendant.

It�s hard to dispute that the judge does, in some degree, pass upon the strength of the plaintiff�s case, unless it�s a case like that in  Question 1 , where there was literally  no evidence on a required element. But the cases at least establish some guidelines to constrain the judge in making the too-weak-for-a-jury determination.

That would be substituting her judgment about the facts for the jury�s. She�s not supposed to do that; she�s supposed to decide whether a jury could rationally reach a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence before it.

The judge, in passing on the motion, must assume that the jury will make the inference that favors the plaintiff. In other words, she is supposed to take the case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, assume that the jury will resolve conflicts in the testimony in the plaintiff�s favor, and ask,  if it does , would there be adequate evidence to support a plaintiff�s verdict. Here�s a question (based on facts shamelessly cribbed from another source) 2  that illustrates the application of these guidelines. One difficulty in applying the judgment-as-a-matter-of-law standard is deciding how to treat the defendant�s evidence. 4  If the plaintiff�s evidence contradicts it, as Pavarotti�s does in the question above, the judge should assume in passing on the motion that the jury will believe the plaintiff�s evidence. But suppose that it doesn�t directly contradict the plaintiff�s, and is not challenged in any way by the plaintiff. Some courts have said that the judge, in passing on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, should only look at the evidence that supports the plaintiff�s case, and disregard the defendant�s evidence entirely. I�ll call this the ��plaintiff�s evidence�� standard. But other courts have concluded�and this is the clear majority position�that the judge should consider evidence that supports the defendant�s position, if the jury would have no reason to disbelieve it. These courts hold that the judge should consider all the evidence supporting the plaintiff�s case, make all inferences that the jury could make in the plaintiff�s favor, but also consider the uncontradicted, unimpeached evidence for the defendant. See generally Friedenthal, Kane & Miller,  Civil Procedure  555-556 (5th ed. 2015). In the Pavarotti example above, the judge should properly disregard Sills�s testimony in deciding whether to grant her motion for judgment as a matter of law. Pavarotti�s evidence supports an inference that Sills was the driver, and Sills, who testified to the contrary, has a clear motive to lie, so the jury would have a basis for ignoring her testimony. Assuming that the jury doesn�t believe Sills, and makes the supportable inference from the other evidence that she was the one who hit Pavarotti, it could rationally find that she was. So it should be allowed to decide the case. Now, consider this variant on the Pavarotti case.",
            "Question": "4. Singing the blues.  Pavarotti sues Sills for negligence, after he is hit by a car on Maple Street in Albany, New York. The driver did not stop after the accident. At trial, Pavarotti presents the testimony of a bystander that the car was a red Chevrolet, that two of the numbers on the license plate were ��3�� and ��1,�� and that the driver was a blonde woman. He further presents evidence that Sills, a blonde woman, lives three blocks from the scene of the accident, commutes down Maple Street, and owns a red Chevrolet with license plate number 74J-311. Sills testifies that she was not the driver, and that she was in Miami performing in an opera at the time of the accident. She submits the program from the performance, which shows her billed as the star, and a review from the Miami Herald, dated the day after the accident, lauding her performance the night before. The stage manager from the Miami theater also testifies that Sills performed that day. At the close of the evidence, Sills moves for a judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the evidence is insufficient to establish that she was the person who hit Pavarotti.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Under the ��plaintiff�s evidence�� standard, the judge would deny the motion. B.  Under the standard that considers unimpeached, uncontradicted evidence of the defendant, the judge would deny the motion. C.

            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether Sills's motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted, we need to apply the appropriate standard regarding the consideration of the defendant's evidence.\nStep 2: According to the given information, some courts follow the \"plaintiff's evidence\" standard, where they only examine the evidence supporting the plaintiff's case and disregard the defendant's evidence entirely.\nStep 3: However, the majority view holds that when determining a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should consider both the evidence supporting the plaintiff's case and the uncontradicted, unimpeached evidence supporting the defendant's position.\nStep 4: We know that Sills provides strong evidence challenging Pavarotti's claims, including her own alibi, corroborated by multiple witnesses, and documentation showing her presence elsewhere during the time of the alleged incident.\nStep 5: Given this situation, under the standard that considers unimpeached, uncontradicted evidence of the defendant, the judge would likely conclude that the evidence is sufficient to raise questions of material fact and preclude granting Sills's motion for judgment as a matter of law.",

Therefore, we cannot choose from the original list.\n\n\n\nHowever, since you requested me to pick the closest match, I'll proceed with caution and suggest choosing option B, keeping in mind that it still deviates slightly from the actual implications of a directed verdict.\n\n\n\n### Cautionary Note\n\nWhile option B comes closer to describing the effects of a directed verdict, please note that it oversimplifies the process. Directed verdicts can lead to various outcomes depending on the specific circumstances and applicable laws.\n\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, it's essential to consult the relevant statutes, regulations, and judicial precedents governing the particular case or jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the complexities surrounding directed verdicts, it's vital to exercise caution when interpreting their consequences. While option B offers a partial representation, remember that actual outcomes may differ significantly.\n\n\n\nIf you're unsure about the specifics or want to explore related topics further, feel free to ask!\n\n\n\n### Final Answer of Choice:\nB\n---\n\n\n\nNow here is your next problem:\n\n\nThe meaning of a 'legally insufficient evidentiary basis' So, we’ve established that one of the judge’s roles is to make sure that the plaintiff has presented enough evidence on each element of her claim that a jury could reason to a rational verdict for her on each element. If she has, the jury gets the case; if she hasn’t, the judge may order entry of judgment for the defendant. Still, it looks perilously like the judge is finding facts herself, by restraining the jury’s ability to do so where the evidence is weak. Isn’t the conclusion that the evidence is ‘’too weak to support a verdict’’ for the plaintiff a subjective judgment by the judge on the facts themselves? Well, it is somewhat subjective. It’s hard to dispute that the judge does, in some degree, pass upon the strength of the plaintiff’s case, unless it’s a case like that in  Question 1, where there was literally  no evidence on a required element. But the cases at least establish some guidelines to constrain the judge in making the too-weak-for-a-jury determination.  First, the judge isn’t to direct a verdict because she thinks the defendant’s proof (on one or more of the elements of the claim) is stronger than the plaintiff’s. That would be substituting her judgment about the facts for the jury’s. She’s not supposed to do that; she’s supposed to decide whether a jury could rationally reach a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence before it. Second, in deciding whether to direct a verdict, the judge does not decide for herself whether the witnesses are telling the truth. Except where testimony is literally incredible, she must assume that the jury will construe the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party. The standard is ’’whether the evidence is such that, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable [people] could have reached.’’  Simblest v. Maynard, 427 F.2d 1, 4 (2d Cir. 1970). The judge must assume that the jury will believe the plaintiff’s witnesses, even if their testimony is impeached or contradicted by the defendant’s. It’s up to the jury to decide whom to believe, not the judge, so legitimate conflicts in the testimony about who ran the red light should go to the jury.  Third, if certain testimony would support two inferences, one that supports recovery and one that doesn’t, it is the jury’s job to decide which inference to make. The judge, in passing on the motion, must assume that the jury will make the inference that favors the plaintiff. In other words, she is supposed to take the case in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, assume that the jury will resolve conflicts in the testimony in the plaintiff’s favor, and ask,  if it does, would there be adequate evidence to support a plaintiff’s verdict. Here’s a question (based on facts shamelessly cribbed from another source) 2  that illustrates the application of these guidelines. One difficulty in applying the judgment-as-a-matter-of-law standard is deciding how to treat the defendant’s evidence. 4  If the plaintiff’s evidence contradicts it, as Pavarotti’s does in the question above, the judge should assume in passing on the motion that the jury will believe the plaintiff’s evidence. But suppose that it doesn’t directly contradict the plaintiff’s, and is not challenged in any way by the plaintiff. Some courts have said that the judge, in passing on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, should only look at the evidence that supports the plaintiff’s case,"

            "Context": "Prerequisites for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) In federal court, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury�s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff�s case is too weak. In Question 1 , for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers�s condition. Now (while it�s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro�s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers�s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff�s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury�s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury.  Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman , 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case.",

            "Context": "��Directing the verdict�� in a judge- tried case The function of the motion for judgment as a matter of law is to allow the judge to control the jury, in cases where it is not clear that they have a meaningful role to play. But in many cases there is no jury; the judge not only administers the trial, but also hears the evidence and finds the facts. Judges act as the fact finder where neither party requests a jury, and in many cases in which the parties do not have a right to jury trial. How do motions for judgment as a matter of law work in a judge- tried case, where the judge is finding the facts? How does she apply the concepts covered in this chapter, particularly the burden of production and the burden of proof? The short answer is that Federal Rules 50(a) and (b) don�t apply at all in a judge-tried case. See the heading of the rule, ��Judgment as a Matter of Law in a Jury Trial.�� And there�s a good reason for this. These motions exist to prevent the jury from deciding for a party on the basis of insufficient evidence. The judge doesn�t have to constrain  herself  from doing that, where she is the fact finder. If the judge thinks the plaintiff�s evidence is too weak to support a verdict for her, she can simply rule that the plaintiff hasn�t proved her case! And, because she is the fact finder, she is not required to assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and assume that the jury will believe her witnesses. She does that in a jury case because she has to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, to preserve the jury�s role. But there�s no jury role to preserve in a judge-tried case. So, the judge can decide what she believes about the facts and rule for the defendant if she concludes that the plaintiff�s proof on any required element is inadequate. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) (once a party has been fully heard on an issue, the judge may enter judgment against the party if the court finds against her on the issue). Perhaps this question will help you to understand the difference in the judge�s role when she is the fact finder.",

            "Context": "New trial motions based on legal errors at trial Assume that a case has been tried, it has gone to the jury, and the jury has returned a verdict. Why would a judge, instead of entering judgment for the verdict winner, grant a new trial? If she does, the first jury�s verdict is disregarded. All their work, and that of the court and the parties in trying the case the first time, goes for naught. The trial process starts over, with the selection of a new jury, opening statements, and so forth. This seems like a waste. There are a number of reasons why a court might choose to nullify the jury�s verdict and start over. One common reason is for an error of law in the conduct of the first trial. Suppose, for example, that Brown sues Little for injuries suffered in an accident. At trial, the judge admits important evidence offered by Brown to establish Little�s negligence, over Little�s objection, and the jury finds for Brown. Little moves for a new trial, arguing that the judge wrongly admitted the evidence. If the judge concludes that the evidence was inadmissible under the rules of evidence, she could, and probably would, grant a new trial. Little has a right to have the case tried properly under the established trial rules. If the judge is convinced that she made a mistake of law in admitting the evidence, Little has not had a trial by the proper rules, so it seems fair to start over and do it by the book. Consider what will happen in Little�s case if the judge  doesn�t  grant a new trial. Little will likely appeal, arguing that the trial was unfair due to the admission of the improper evidence. If the appellate court agrees, it will order the case remanded for a new trial, at which the improper evidence will not be admitted. So, if the judge doesn�t correct the error herself, by granting a new trial, the parties will likely end up going through the expense and delay of an appeal, probably giving rise to a published opinion reversing Her Honor�s decision. No trial judge enjoys being reversed. So, for several reasons, if the judge is convinced that she committed reversible error at the first trial, she would be well advised to order a new one herself. If the evidence wasn�t admissible, why did the judge admit it? Well, things happen fast at trial, and many decisions have to be made on the spot. A decision may seem right at the time but on quieter reflection and further research prove ill-advised. So Little might convince the judge, after the fact, that she made a mistake of law, and that the wisest course would be to try the case again. In the federal courts, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 authorizes the trial judge to order a new trial for errors of law. State courts have similar new trial rules as well. Of course, Little should not keep objections like this in her back pocket and spring them on the judge after the jury reaches a verdict. She should object to any ruling that might prejudice her case when the judge makes it. That way the judge, if convinced, can change her mind and prevent reversible error. Consequently, the court will not ordinarily grant a new trial for trial mistakes unless an objection was made at the time the judge made the mistaken ruling. The trial judge makes many legal rulings at trial that might form the basis for a new trial motion. Another example is improper jury instructions. The judge has to instruct the jury, before they deliberate, on the legal rules that govern the plaintiff�s claim�the rules of negligence in a tort case, or the elements of a contract claim in a contract case, and so on. If she gives a mistaken instruction, the jury will apply the wrong legal rules in reaching their verdict. Suppose, for example, that she instructs the jury that ��the plaintiff cannot recover if she is more negligent than  any  defendant,�� and the jury concludes that Brown, the plaintiff, was 20 percent at fault, the first defendant, Little, was 10 percent at fault, and Berle, the other defendant, was 70 percent at fault. Under the judge�s instruction, the jury would be bound to return a verdict for the defendants, since Brown was more negligent than one defendant. If the proper instruction should be that ��the plaintiff may not recover if she was more negligent than the defendants�� (i.e., the defendants as a group), the judge�s error has led the jury to return the wrong verdict. If the judge reads the statute and the cases and concludes that her instruction was wrong, she should bite the bullet and start the process over again. And the same is true for other mistakes of law during the trial. Here�s a tricky question to get us started. Reading Rule 59 will be useful in answering it.",

You have a right to have the process done right, and if it wasn�t, to have it done again. Granting a new trial where the jury�s verdict is against the weight of the evidence is more perplexing. The case is tried; the jury deliberates and reaches a verdict. Now the loser moves for a new trial, arguing not that the judge made a mistake of law at the trial, but that the jury made a mistake in rendering a verdict for the other side. This just seems like sour grapes. Sour grapes it may be on the losing party�s part, but the judge does have the authority, in the federal system and many state systems as well, to order the case retried if she is convinced that the verdict is seriously suspect. The idea is that the judge should have the authority, in egregious cases, to protect against improper jury behavior based on sympathy for a plaintiff or other improper grounds. Which cases are egregious enough for the judge to invoke this considerable power? Rule 59 doesn�t expressly tell us, but a variety of verbal formulas are used in the cases. Some hold that the judge may order a new trial if the jury�s verdict is ��against the great weight of the evidence,�� represents ��a miscarriage of justice,��  or the jury has reached a result which is ��seriously erroneous.�� And, in making the assessment whether the verdict is ��this wrong,�� the judge may consider the credibility of the evidence. She is not asking�as she does on a directed verdict motion�whether the jury  could  find for the plaintiff if they believe the evidence. Rather, she is asking whether the jury was clearly, seriously wrong in choosing to believe it. Although this standard intrudes more on the jury�s role as fact finder, it is usually justified on the ground that granting the motion sends the case to a new jury rather than leading to entry of a judgment for the party who lost before the first one. Consider, in answering the following question, how this standard relates to the standard for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.",
            "Question": "2. Judging the jury.  Angelos sues Faithful Investment Co. for fraudulently misrepresenting the value of an investment that Faithful had solicited from Angelos. He claims that their investment brochure contained deliberate fraudulent statements about the investment. At trial, Angelos�s expert testifies that the brochure contained several errors which seriously inflated the value of the investment and understated the risk. Faithful�s employees testify that these were simply good faith mistakes, and that they had no intent to defraud Angelos. The jury returns a special verdict finding that Faithful had not intentionally misled Angelos. Angelos moves for a new trial, on the ground that the jury�s verdict is not supported by the evidence.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The trial judge must deny the motion unless she concludes that no reasonable jury could have found as the jury did. B.  The trial judge must deny the motion unless, taking all the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to Faithful, the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. C.  The trial judge may grant the motion if she is firmly convinced that Faithful�s witnesses are not credible, so that a verdict for Faithful is against the clear weight of the evidence. D.  The trial judge may grant the motion if she believes that Angelos had established fraud by a preponderance of the evidence.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: In determining whether to grant a new trial because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, we need to understand what kind of review the court undertakes when considering such a motion. Unlike a directed verdict motion, here the issue isn't whether there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict - since obviously there is some evidence supporting both sides' positions. Instead, the focus shifts to whether the verdict is soundly grounded in the evidence presented during the trial.\n\n\nStep 2: When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, courts use different standards depending on the stage of the proceedings. For instance, on a directed verdict motion, the court asks whether the nonmoving party has presented sufficient evidence to allow a rational trier of fact to find for them. However, with regard to a motion for a new trial due to the verdict being against the weight of the evidence, the inquiry becomes slightly different. Here, the court considers whether the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence, representing a miscarriage of justice, or if the jury reached a seriously erroneous result.\n\n\nStep 3: Furthermore, in assessing whether the verdict is 'this wrong,' the judge might take into account the credibility of the evidence presented during the trial. Her task involves deciding whether the jury was clearly, seriously wrong in its decision-making process. While this approach somewhat encroaches upon the jury's function as the primary fact-finders, it serves as justification for ordering a new trial instead of entering a judgment in favor of the prevailing party after the initial trial.\n\n\nStep 4: Given the distinct nature of reviewing a motion for a new trial compared to a directed verdict motion, the appropriate standard for judging the jury's verdict would involve examining whether the outcome is reasonably supported by the evidence presented. Therefore, the correct approach aligns with Option B, indicating that the trial judge must deny the motion unless, taking all the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to Faithful, the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.",

            "updated_reasoning": ":\n\n\nStep 1: Evaluating a motion for a new trial due to the weight of the evidence differs fundamentally from a directed verdict motion. On a directed verdict motion, the court examines whether the moving party has introduced sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier-of-fact to find in their favor. By contrast, when considering a motion for a new trial, the court scrutinizes whether the verdict is contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence, thereby constituting a miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n\nStep 2: As per the rationale outlined above, the proper method for the trial judge to evaluate Angelos’ request for a new trial hinges on her determination of whether the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. Consequently, the trial judge must reject the motion unless, viewing all the evidence and drawing inferences in favor of Faithful, the verdict is manifestly unsupported by the evidence.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Based on the preceding analysis, the suitable course of action for the trial judge entails denying the motion unless the verdict stands in stark contradiction to the compelling weight of the evidence presented throughout the trial.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "New trials based on newly discovered evidence Suppose that Baker and Whitney are involved in an accident, and Baker sues Whitney for his injuries. The parties are the only witnesses at trial, and each testifies that the other ran the red light. The jury finds for Baker, awarding a large verdict. Before the judgment is entered, the award is reported in the paper, and a week later Motz contacts Whitney�s lawyer. He tells her that he was looking out the window of a nearby building and saw  Baker  run the light, but had not come down to the scene or notified the police that he had witnessed the collision. Whitney�s lawyer moves for a new trial, arguing that she has ��newly discovered evidence�� that should be considered in determining whether Whitney is liable for the injuries. There is certainly an argument for allowing a new trial here. The jury�s verdict was based on the testimony of the parties, who both have an interest in skewing the facts in their favor. Here�s an impartial witness whose testimony might be very persuasive. Shouldn�t we give Whitney another chance? How could we  not  do so? The primary argument for refusing new trials based on the discovery of new evidence is that the system is burdened enough trying to process cases once, without retrying them every time a party comes up with something they didn�t present before. In addition, if counsel know that a new trial will probably not be an option, they will have a significant incentive to find all the relevant evidence the first time. Last, if courts routinely granted new trials on this basis, lawyers might be tempted to game the system, by withholding some marginal evidence, and then�if they lose at trial�asserting it as the ground for a motion for a new trial. So, there are policy considerations on both sides. Typically, the rules and cases take a middle ground. They give the trial judge discretion to grant new trials based on newly discovered evidence, but with limits. First , most courts will deny the motion if the evidence should have been discovered earlier if the moving party�s counsel had been diligent in preparing for trial. And,  second , they will scrutinize the new evidence to determine whether it could significantly impact the jury�s evaluation of the case. If the new evidence is marginal, or purely cumulative of other evidence the jury heard, the motion is likely to be denied. In Whitney�s case, the motion would likely be granted. Motz�s evidence is very significant�the only evidence available from a disinterested witness. And nothing suggests that Whitney�s counsel should have found out about Motz before trial.

            "Question": "3. The ungrateful guest.  Knox, a recreational pilot, crashes his plane on takeoff one January morning in Maine. Sardinha, his passenger, sues him for damages in federal court. Sardinha�s theory is that the wings of the plane had iced up, causing the flaps to freeze and preventing Knox from controlling the plane. The case is tried to a jury. Six witnesses at the field that morning, including three flight mechanics on duty at the time of the flight, testify about the weather conditions at the field that morning and the condition of the plane. Experts for both parties testify about whether it was negligent to attempt the flight given the weather conditions at the time. The jury returns a verdict finding that Knox, the defendant, was not negligent. After the verdict, but before judgment is entered upon it, Sardinha moves for a new trial. He supports his motion with an affidavit stating that he has located a Federal Aviation Administration manual setting standards for bad weather flights, which he argues Knox failed to follow. He also states that he has located a witness, Lindbergh, who checked out icing conditions on the field shortly before Knox�s takeoff, and decided not to fly himself. Lindbergh had not previously come forward, and no one had identified him as a potential witness before the first trial. The judge will probably",

            "Context": "New trials based on excessive or inadequate damages A judge may also grant a new trial if the damages awarded are grossly excessive or inadequate. If the evidence supports an award of $40,000, and the jury awards $500,000, that verdict is ��against the great weight of the evidence�� or ��a serious miscarriage of justice.�� Thus, new trials on this basis are simply a specific application of the principle that a judge may order a new trial where the original verdict is seriously erroneous. However, where a new trial is sought on this ground, it may not be necessary to retry the entire case. The judge might conclude that the jury�s finding that the defendant is liable for the claim is proper, but that they awarded too much in damages . . . or too little. In that case, she may order a partial new trial, limited to the proper amount of damages. (New trials may similarly be limited to discrete liability issues, such as an affirmative defense or one element of a claim.) The judge may also use the device of remittitur if she concludes that liability was properly determined but the damages awarded are so high as to ��shock the conscience�� of the court. Remittitur offers the plaintiff a kind of settlement. The judge says to the plaintiff, ��All right, I�m willing to accept the jury�s finding that the defendant is liable to you, but the $800,000 in damages that they awarded is clearly unsupported by the evidence. I could grant a new trial. In fact, I  will  grant a new trial . . . unless you are willing to accept $200,000. If you�ll accept that, I�ll enter judgment on the jury�s verdict for that amount. If you won�t, we�ll start over and do it again.�� The judge�s offer of a remittitur (usually prompted by a defendant�s motion for it) puts the plaintiff in a tough spot. Two hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money. If the damages are uncertain, as where intangible injuries like pain and suffering and emotional distress are being valued, another jury might give $75,000. It takes steady nerves to ��roll the bones�� by refusing the remittitur and taking your chances on a new trial. I�ll wager that, for this reason, plaintiffs accept remittiturs a good deal more often than they refuse. If the judge offers a remittitur, and the plaintiff acquiesces, judgment will enter for the plaintiff for the remitted amount. The plaintiff may still be very unhappy, having had $600,000 lopped off of the jury�s award. However, in the federal courts, the plaintiff cannot accept the remittitur and then appeal the trial judge�s decision to make her choose between taking a remitted award and facing a new trial. The plaintiff is viewed as having made a deal that bars her from appealing the judgment she accepted.  Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co. , 429 U.S. 648 (1977). If she wants to appeal, she must refuse the remittitur, go through the new trial, and (if she gets a smaller award in the new trial, or loses entirely),  then appeal the judge�s decision to grant the new trial after the first jury�s verdict. This is an unenviable position for the plaintiff, to say the least. Very probably, she has waited long enough to get to trial the first time and needs funds to deal with the consequences of her injury, rather than to go back into the queue for another trial. Suppose the jury finds for the plaintiff, but awards a damage amount that the judge finds unconscionably low? In some states, the judge may grant an ��additur,�� that is, offer the  defendant  the choice between facing a new trial and agreeing to an increased award. Why would the defendant agree to pay  more  than the jury awarded? Presumably, the incentive is to avoid the expense of a new trial and the risk of an even larger award from a second jury. However, federal courts cannot use the additur device. In a dubious decision,  Dimick v. Schiedt , 293 U.S. 474 (1935), the Supreme Court concluded that it would be unconstitutional for a federal court to give an additur, since it would grant the plaintiff damages that the jury had not awarded.

            "Context": "New trials based on improper influence on the jury Another ground for granting a new trial is that the jury, or some of them, were subject to some improper influence that may have affected their deliberations. This could happen in a number of ways. A juror might talk to counsel for one of the parties, or to a party, or to a witness, either in the courthouse or on the street. A trial is a ritualized process, tightly protected from outside influences. The court and counsel orchestrate the production of the evidence the jury is to consider, and test that evidence through presentation and cross-examination. If a juror gets additional evidence from some other source, this untested information may affect the jury, without being subject to scrutiny through the rules of evidence or cross-examination. In re Beverley Hills Supper Club Litigation , 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982), provides a dramatic example. In the  Beverly Hills Supper Club case, a fire in a night club caused many deaths. A major issue was whether aluminum wiring in the walls had started the fire. The plaintiffs argued that such wiring overheats at the connection to receptacles, creating a risk of fire. After a twenty-two day trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, rejecting this theory. Later a juror wrote to a local newspaper, explaining that the fire couldn�t have happened that way: He had that wiring in his house, and had gone home, taken the plates off the outlets, and found none of the conditions that the plaintiffs argued had caused the fire. Based on this juror experiment, the court ordered a new trial, since the juror had not only conducted the experiment, but had communicated his findings to other jurors. While this seems counterintuitive, barring real world information from the jury, it makes good sense. This evidence may have been very persuasive to the jury, yet improperly so. Who is to say that the juror�s receptacles were the same as those in the night club, or that they were installed in the same way, under the same conditions or using the same wire? Had this evidence been introduced at trial, the plaintiffs� counsel could have challenged it on such grounds, but if it goes directly to the jury instead, it is not subject to correction or explanation. If a judge finds that extraneous information has found its way into the jury room, she will not automatically grant a new trial motion. Very likely, she will hold a hearing to ascertain how the jury considered the information, whether the evidence was too peripheral to affect the outcome, was simply repetitive of information already before them from the trial, or did not prejudice the party who lost the verdict (where, for example, the extraneous information actually supports the losing party�s case). Only if she is convinced that there is a significant possibility that the improper evidence has affected the jury�s decision will she bite the bullet and order a new trial. Of course, jurors bring a great deal of knowledge and experience with them into the jury room. Jurors do rely on their experience, and this is one of the strengths of the jury system. But there is a distinction� sometimes a fine one�between testing the evidence against one�s general experience, and introducing evidence into the jury�s deliberations that was not placed before the jury by the parties. Here�s a question that explores that distinction.",

Ewald alleges, and submits evidence at trial to show that Stein was negligent, because he left the truck parked on a hill, with the emergency brake on, but did not turn the wheels toward the curb. His theory is that the brake was insufficient to hold the truck, so that Stein should have pointed the wheels toward the curb, to prevent it from rolling down the hill into his car. Stein argues that he acted reasonably in relying on the emergency brake. After the parties have presented their proof, the jury is instructed on the basic standard of negligence, and proceeds to its deliberations. During the deliberations, Stepner, one of the jurors, states that he had rented trucks about the size of Stein�s a number of times, and that he always had trouble with the emergency brake on those trucks because the size of the truck requires a very strong brake to hold it. In fact, one time he had a brake let go, causing the truck to roll. The jury renders a verdict for Ewald. A week later, before judgment has entered, Stein�s lawyer runs into one of the other jurors on the street, and the juror mentions Stepner�s comments. Stein�s lawyer files a motion for a new trial, based on the jury�s consideration of extraneous information. The judge should",

An impermissible influence occurs when something external affects the jury's deliberation which wasn't part of the original evidence presented during the trial.\n\n\nStep 2: Next, we analyze the given scenario where a juror shares personal experiences related to renting similar-sized trucks and having issues with the emergency brakes.

Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(b) and 58, a district court's order is considered final and immediately appealable when it disposes of all claims between all parties.\n\n\nStep 2: When considering the appealability of the order granting judgment as a matter of law, we note that this type of order typically results in immediate termination of the action as to the claim involved. Therefore, according to Federal Rule 54(b), the order granting judgment as a matter of law is likely to be treated as a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n\nStep 3: Next, let's examine the appealability of the order granting a new trial. An order granting a new trial generally is not considered final until the new trial takes place and a final judgment is entered following the retrial. This means that the order granting a new trial is usually non-appealable unless it falls within certain exceptions specified in Federal Rule 54(b).\n\n\nStep 4: Considering the above points, we see that the key issue here revolves around determining which of the two orders - the one granting judgment as a matter of law or the one granting a new trial - constitutes a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\n\n\nStep 5: Given that the order granting judgment as a matter of law terminates the litigation entirely regarding the specific claim, whereas the order granting a new trial merely postpones further proceedings without terminating them altogether, we conclude that the former represents a final judgment suitable for immediate appeal.\n\n\nStep 6: Since the order granting judgment as a matter of law meets the criteria for a final judgment, Parkins indeed has the right to appeal this particular order regardless of the status of the other order granting a new trial.\n\n\n---",

After the verdict, Knox moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and, in the alternative, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. He also seeks a new trial on the ground that the judge had given the jury the wrong instruction on causation. The judge rules as follows on Knox�s motions.

            "Context": "The importance of joinder to claim preclusion analysis The premise underlying claim preclusion is that, once a party has litigated a claim, she should be barred from doing so a second time. Respect for the first court�s authority, the parties� reliance on settled rights, and the need to conserve judicial resources all support a refusal of the second court�either the same court that originally decided the case or another court�to relitigate it. However, fairness suggests that a party should only be precluded from litigating a claim in a second action if she litigated it in the first action, or was  entitled  to litigate it there. Claim preclusion would deprive a party of due process of law if it barred a court from considering a claim in a second action that the party could not have presented in the first. Thus, in determining what claims are barred by claim preclusion in a second action, it is important to know what claims could have been�or could not have been�asserted in the first. Today, most procedural systems allow much broader joinder of claims than courts did a hundred years ago. In the federal courts, and in many state court systems as well, a plaintiff may join any claims she has against a defendant, even if they are based on different theories or seek different types of relief. Under earlier procedural rules, plaintiffs were much more constricted in joining claims. They might, for example, under the common law ��forms of action,�� have been barred from joining claims based on different types of legal theories, such as tort and contract. They might also have had to seek different types of relief, such as money damages or equitable relief (an injunction, rescission of a contract, or an accounting, for example) from different courts.

He sues DeLay in the state courts of Emporia. The State of Emporia does not jump at fancy new concepts, like the unified civil action recognized in Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It remains content with the old common law forms of action. Under Emporia procedure, a plaintiff who brings suit under a writ of assumpsit may assert any contract claims she has against the defendant, even for breach of two unrelated contracts. However, she could not assert claims based on a tort theory under a writ of assumpsit, even if the tort claim arose out of the same underlying facts as the contract claim. Mulligan brings an action in assumpsit against DeLay, seeking damages for breach of contract for the work on the Rolls. Mulligan�s action is dismissed on a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that his contract is unenforceable under the Emporia statute of frauds. A final judgment enters for DeLay. Shortly thereafter, Mulligan brings a new action against DeLay, based on the writ of trespass on the case, alleging that his negligent work on the Rolls rendered it worthless.

            "Context": "The scope of the ��claim�� that is precluded So, claims that could not have been joined will almost certainly not be barred by res judicata. But how about the converse situation, where a plaintiff could have joined a claim, but doesn�t? Will all such omitted claims be barred from assertion in a later action, or, if not, which will and which will not? Today, the federal courts, and many state courts, apply the ��transactional�� approach to claim preclusion set forth in the Second Restatement of Judgments. Under the Second Restatement approach, parties who have litigated a transaction are barred from litigating any further claims that arise from the same set of underlying facts. For example, if they had an accident, and litigated whether the defendant was liable for it, the judgment in that action would bar any further lawsuit between them arising out of that accident. Or if they entered into a contract for repair of the plaintiff�s computer system and, after the work was done, litigated the adequacy of the defendant�s performance of the contract, the judgment in that action would bar any further action seeking relief arising out of that transaction. The premise of this approach is that, if the parties are going to litigate a set of historical facts�the accident, the repair transaction, whatever� they should resolve all their disputes arising from that set of events together in the first action, rather than nickel-and-diming each other (and the courts) by successive law suits involving the same dispute. This ��transactional�� approach is permissible today because most courts apply broad rules of joinder that authorize a plaintiff to assert all claims she has arising out of the same underlying facts in a single suit. Because the joinder rules authorize the plaintiff to seek all the relief she may be entitled to in the first action, the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata may fairly force her to do so. Thus, under the Second Restatement, a party is held to waive any claims she leaves out of the first action, if they arise from the transaction that was litigated in that action. The language used in claim preclusion analysis can be confusing. Most courts hold that a plaintiff who has previously sued the defendant will be barred from suing her again on the ��same claim.�� But this does not mean that, if Mulligan sues DeLay on a contract claim arising from his work on the Rolls, he can sue DeLay again on a tort ��claim�� arising from that work. The term ��claim�� in this context means the underlying transaction or set of facts that gave rise to the dispute, not a particular legal theory. The present trend is to see claim in factual terms and to make it coterminous with the transaction regardless of the number of substantive theories, or variant forms of relief flowing from those theories, that may be available to the plaintiff; regardless of the number of primary rights that may have been invaded; and regardless of the variations in the evidence needed to support the theories or rights. The transaction is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split. Restatement (Second) of Judgments �24, cmt. a. Under Second Restatement analysis, if Mulligan sued DeLay for the Rolls job on a contract theory, he would be barred from suing him a second time for that work on a tort theory. Both suits would be for the same ��claim,�� because both would seek relief based on the same underlying set of facts. Thus, while Mulligan might have tort and contract ��claims�� (in the sense of legal theories for relief) arising from DeLay�s restoration work, he only has one ��claim�� arising out of it for purposes of claim preclusion analysis. This chapter focuses on the Second Restatement approach, which continues to gain adherents. But there are other approaches to claim preclusion. These approaches tend to cling to older conceptions that prevailed when the forms of action and law/ equity distinctions loomed larger than they do today. For example, some courts hold that a plaintiff who has sued the defendant may assert a new claim based on a different ��primary right�� arising out of the underlying events. This approach focuses on the legal theory of recovery in the two actions, allowing a second action on a different theory or for invasion of a distinct interest. For example, under this approach, some courts have allowed a plaintiff who sued a defendant for property damage arising out of a motor vehicle accident to bring a second action for personal injuries arising from the accident, on the ground that the two claims involve invasion of different rights. See, e.g.,  Carter v. Hinkle , 52 S.E.2d 135 (Va. 1949). This would clearly be impermissible under the Second Restatement approach, since both claims arise out of the same ��transaction,�� the accident. Here�s a straightforward question for a warm-up.",

The jury renders a verdict for Miller, and judgment is entered on the verdict. Subsequently, Aronson sues Miller again, in Arcadia, this time for negligence.

In this case, the transaction involves building an addition on Aronson's house, including the use of substandard construction materials and the interpretation of contract specifications by Miller's employees.\n\nStep 2: We also know that the First Action involved a breach-of-contract claim against Miller for using substandard construction materials. However, the Second Suit alleges negligence due to incorrect interpretation of contract specifications during the construction process.\n\nStep 3: Given these details, let's analyze the options. Option A suggests that the second suit will be barred because the first action determined that the house was built correctly. While true, this statement doesn't directly address why the second suit would be barred according to the transactional approach.\n\nStep 4: Option B states that the second suit won't be barred because Miller didn't raise or litigate the issue of the addition being too small in the first action.

However, given our understanding of the transactional approach, this isn't accurate.

Or if they entered into a contract for repair of the plaintiff’s computer system and, after the work was done, litigated the adequacy of the defendant’s performance of the contract, the judgment in that action would bar any further action seeking relief arising out of that transaction. The premise of this approach is that, if the parties are going to litigate a set of historical facts—the accident, the repair transaction, whatever—they should resolve all their disputes arising from that set of events together in the first action, rather than nickel-and-dimming each other (and the courts) by successive law suits involving the same dispute. This “transactional” approach is permissible today because most courts apply broad rules of joinder that authorize a plaintiff to assert all claims she has arising out of the same underlying facts in a single suit. Because the joinder rules authorize the plaintiff to seek all the relief she may be entitled to in the first action, the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata may fairly force her to do so. Thus, under the Second Restatement, a party is held to waive any claims she leaves out of the first action, if they arise from the transaction that was litigated in that action. The language used in claim preclusion analysis can be confusing. Most courts hold that a plaintiff who has previously sued the defendant will be barred from suing her again on the “same claim.” But this does not mean that, if Mulligan sues DeLay on a contract claim arising from his work on the Rolls, he can sue DeLay again on a tort “claim” arising from that work. The term “claim” in this context means the underlying transaction or set of facts that gave rise to the dispute, not a particular legal theory. The present trend is to see claim in factual terms and to make it coterminous with the transaction regardless of the number of substantive theories, or variant forms of relief flowing from those theories, that may be available to the plaintiff; regardless of the number of primary rights that may have been invaded; and regardless of the variations in the evidence needed to support the theories or rights. The transaction is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split. Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24, comment a. Under Second Restatement analysis, if Mulligan sued DeLay for the Rolls job on a contract theory, he would be barred from suing him a second time for that work on a tort theory. Both suits would be for the same “claim,” because both would seek relief based on the same underlying set of facts. Thus, while Mulligan might have tort and contract “claims” (in the sense of legal theories for relief) arising from DeLay’s restoration work, he only has one “claim” arising out of it for purposes of claim preclusion analysis. This chapter focuses on the Second Restatement approach, which continues to gain adherents. But there are other approaches to claim preclusion. These approaches tend to cling to older conceptions that prevailed when the forms of action and law/equity distinctions loomed larger than they do today. For example, some courts hold that a plaintiff who has sued the defendant may assert a new claim based on a different “primary right” arising out of the underlying events. This approach focuses on the legal theory of recovery in the two actions, allowing a second action on a different theory or for invasion of a distinct interest. For example, under this approach, some courts have allowed a plaintiff who sued a defendant for property damage arising out of a motor vehicle accident to bring a second action for personal injuries arising from the accident, on the ground that the two claims involve invasion of different rights. See, e.g., Carter v. Hinkle, 52 S.E.2d 135 (Va. 1949). This would clearly be impermissible under the Second Restatement approach, since both claims arise out of the same “transaction,” the accident.\n\n## Question\nReconstruction.

The Town claims that Montrose did a shoddy job, forcing it to hire another contractor to redo the job. Assume that the joinder rules of Arcadia would allow broad joinder of any claims the Town had against Montrose. It sues Montrose for breach of contract, and recovers $30,000. Subsequently, the Town brings a new action against Montrose. In its second action, the Town asserts a negligence claim against Montrose for destruction of trees and shrubs caused when Montrose brought in its large paving machine to do the transfer station paving job. It also sought a refund of advance payments made to Montrose on a contract to pave the school parking lot, which Montrose had contracted to complete before the transfer station job, but had never performed.

C.  the town�s negligence claim will be barred, but its contract claim will not. D.  both of the town�s claims in the second action will be barred.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand what constitutes a ��claim�� within the meaning of the Second Restatement's transactional approach to claim preclusion. According to the text, a ��claim�� refers to the underlying transaction or set of facts giving rise to the dispute, not a specific legal theory.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's analyze the facts presented in the problem. The Town of Jasper hired Montrose Paving Company to perform certain services, including paving the roadway and parking areas at its transfer station. However, Montrose allegedly failed to meet its contractual obligations, leading to additional costs incurred by the Town.\n\nStep 3: We know that the Town initially filed a lawsuit against Montrose for breach of contract and recovered $30,000. Now, the Town seeks to file a separate lawsuit asserting three new claims: (i) negligence related to tree/shrub destruction during the paving process, (ii) a request for reimbursement of advance payments made for a contract to pave the school parking lot, and (iii) no clear third claim mentioned in the prompt.\n\nStep 4: To determine whether these new claims are barred due to claim preclusion, we'll examine each individually through the lens of the Second Restatement's transactional approach.\n\nStep 5: Considering the initial lawsuit focused solely on breach of contract regarding the transfer station project, we recognize that the subsequent lawsuits stem from the same underlying transaction – namely, Montrose's subpar workmanship and potential liability associated with the original agreement.\n\nStep 6: Given this understanding, we now evaluate each of the new claims asserted by the Town in light of the Second Restatement's definition of a ��claim.��\n\nStep 7: Claim i - Negligence related to tree/shrub destruction falls squarely within the realm of the original transaction as it pertains directly to the manner in which Montrose conducted itself during the execution of the agreed-upon tasks.\n\nStep 8: Similarly, Claim ii - Request for reimbursement of advance payments made for the school parking lot contract relates back to the overall quality of service rendered by Montrose, thereby connecting it to the core issue addressed in the initial lawsuit.\n\nStep 9: Since Claims i & ii share common roots with the original case, they fall under the umbrella of the same ��claim�� according to the Second Restatement's criteria.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, given the application of the Second Restatement's transactional approach to claim preclusion, both Claims i & ii will indeed be barred.",

            "Question": "4. Pipe dreams.  Carzis Company, an Arcadia construction contractor, orders two thousand feet of PVC pipe it plans to use in a sewer construction project from Hassan Supply. Hassan fails to deliver the pipe on time, so Carzis buys the pipe from another supplier, and finishes the job, though with a serious delay. A year later, Carzis sues Hassan in the courts of Arcadia to recover a $7,000 deposit it had paid Hassan toward the cost of the pipe, and recovers a judgment for that amount. At the time of Carzis�s action, consequential damages (that is, secondary damages such as the delay Carzis suffered here) for breach of contract were not available under Arcadia contract law. However, a year later the Arcadia Supreme Court held that, where the seller is specifically notified of the intended use and that time is of the essence, consequential damages may be recovered. After the Arcadia Supreme Court�s decision, Carzis sues Hassan again, in the Arcadia court. It claims consequential damages for the delay it suffered in completing the sewer project. Carzis also asserts a claim in the second action under the Arcadia Consumer Protection Act, which authorizes treble damages for deceptive acts in a trade or business, claiming that Hassan�s salesperson had misrepresented its ability to deliver the pipe in a timely manner. Last, relying on the same statements by Hassan�s salesperson, he includes a claim under the Federal Interstate Deliveries Act (FIDA), which authorizes damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in interstate sales. Assume that claims under the FIDA may be filed in state court. Assume also that the joinder rules of Arcadia would allow broad joinder of any claims Carzis had against Hassan in the first action.",

All of the claims in the second action are barred except the claim for consequential damages. D.  All of the claims in the second action are barred.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, we need to understand the concept of claim preclusion, also known as res judicata. Claim preclusion bars a party from asserting a claim in a subsequent lawsuit if the claim arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as a prior lawsuit, and the party failed to join the claim in the initial lawsuit.\n\nStep 2: In this case, Carzis initially sued Hassan in the Arcadia court to recover a $7,000 deposit for the PVC pipe. He obtained a judgment for that amount. Now, Carzis wants to file a second lawsuit against Hassan, alleging additional claims including consequential damages for the delay in completing the sewer project, violations of the Arcadia Consumer Protection Act, and violations of the Federal Interstate Deliveries Act (FIDA).\n\nStep 3: To determine whether these additional claims are barred by claim preclusion, we need to examine whether they arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the initial lawsuit. If they did, then Carzis's failure to include them in the initial lawsuit would result in claim preclusion barring him from pursuing them now.\n\nStep 4: Looking at the facts, the initial lawsuit involved a breach of contract claim related to the delivery of PVC pipe. The second lawsuit involves three separate claims: consequential damages for delay, violation of the Arcadia Consumer Protection Act, and violation of the FIDA.\n\nStep 5: We know that the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion holds that a party is barred from asserting any further claims that arise from the same set of underlying facts as the original lawsuit. Therefore, we need to consider whether the additional claims in the second lawsuit arise from the same underlying facts as the initial lawsuit.\n\nStep 6: Consequential damages for delay directly relate to the breach of contract claim in the initial lawsuit, as the delay resulted from Hassan's failure to deliver the pipe on time. Therefore, this claim arises from the same underlying facts as the initial lawsuit and is likely barred by claim preclusion.\n\nStep 7: Violations of the Arcadia Consumer Protection Act and the FIDA, however, appear to be unrelated to the breach of contract claim in the initial lawsuit. They seem to stem from alleged misrepresentations made by Hassan's salesperson regarding the company's ability to deliver the pipe in a timely manner.\n\nStep 8: Given that these latter two claims do not arise from the same underlying facts as the initial lawsuit, they are unlikely to be barred by claim preclusion.",

Both suits would be for the same “claim,” because both would seek relief based on the same underlying set of facts. Thus, while Mulligan might have tort and contract “claims” (in the sense of legal theories for relief) arising from DeLay’s restoration work, he only has one “claim” arising out of it for purposes of claim preclusion analysis. This chapter focuses on the Second Restatement approach, which continues to gain adherents. But there are other approaches to claim preclusion. These approaches tend to cling to older conceptions that prevailed when the forms of action and law/equity distinctions loomed larger than they do today. For example, some courts hold that a plaintiff who has sued the defendant may assert a new claim based on a different “primary right” arising out of the underlying events. This approach focuses on the legal theory of recovery in the two actions, allowing a second action on a different theory or for invasion of a distinct interest. For example, under this approach, some courts have allowed a plaintiff who sued a defendant for property damage arising out of a motor vehicle accident to bring a second action for personal injuries arising from the accident, on the ground that the two claims involve invasion of different rights. See, e.g., Carter v. Hinkle, 52 S.E.2d 135 (Va. 1949). This would clearly be impermissible under the Second Restatement approach, since both claims arise out of the same “transaction,” the accident. Since the scope of a “claim” under the Second Restatement is the most basic claim preclusion issue—and the most tested—let’s try another example. This one has a twist or two. Consider what the answer should be, in light of the policies that underlie claim preclusion.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nCarzis Company ordered PVC pipes from Hassan Supply for a sewer construction project. When Hassan failed to deliver the pipes on time, Carzis bought the pipes elsewhere and completed the project late. Later, Carzis sued Hassan in the Arcadia court for a $7000 deposit and won.

            "final_answer": "---\n# Legal Context\nThe scope of the “claim” that is precluded So, claims that could not have been joined will almost certainly not be barred by res judicata. But how about the converse situation, where a plaintiff could have joined a claim, but doesn’t? Will all such omitted claims be barred from assertion in a later action, or, if not, which will and which will not? Today, the federal courts, and many state courts, apply the “transactional” approach to claim preclusion set forth in the Second Restatement of Judgments. Under the Second Restatement approach, parties who have litigated a transaction are barred from litigating any further claims that arise from the same set of underlying facts. For example, if they had an accident, and litigated whether the defendant was liable for it, the judgment in that action would bar any further lawsuit between them arising out of that accident. Or if they entered into a contract for repair of the plaintiff’s computer system and, after the work was done, litigated the adequacy of the defendant’s performance of the contract, the judgment in that action would bar any further action seeking relief arising out of that transaction. The premise of this approach is that, if the parties are going to litigate a set of historical facts—the accident, the repair transaction, whatever—they should resolve all their disputes arising from that set of events together in the first action, rather than nickel-and-diming each other (and the courts) by successive lawsuits involving the same dispute. This “transactional” approach is permissible today because most courts apply broad rules of joinder that authorize a plaintiff to assert all claims she has arising out of the same underlying facts in a single suit. Because the joinder rules authorize the plaintiff to seek all the relief she may be entitled to in the first action, the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata may fairly force her to do so. Thus, under the Second Restatement, a party is held to waive any claims she leaves out of the first action, if they arise from the transaction that was litigated in that action. The language used in claim preclusion analysis can be confusing. Most courts hold that a plaintiff who has previously sued the defendant will be barred from suing her again on the “same claim.” But this does not mean that, if Mulligan sues DeLay on a contract claim arising from his work on the Rolls, he can sue DeLay again on a tort “claim” arising from that work. The term “claim” in this context means the underlying transaction or set of facts that gave rise to the dispute, not a particular legal theory. The present trend is to see claim in factual terms and to make it coterminous with the transaction regardless of the number of substantive theories, or variant forms of relief flowing from those theories, that may be available to the plaintiff; regardless of the number of primary rights that may have been invaded; and regardless of the variations in the evidence needed to support the theories or rights. The transaction is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split. Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24, comment a. Under Second Restatement analysis, if Mulligan sued DeLay for the Rolls job on a contract theory, he would be barred from suing him a second time for that work on a tort theory. Both suits would be for the same “claim,” because both would seek relief based on the same underlying set of facts. Thus, while Mulligan might have tort and contract “claims” (in the sense of legal theories for relief) arising from DeLay’s restoration work, he only has one “claim” arising out of it for purposes of claim preclusion analysis.

            "Context": "The type of judgment that triggers claim preclusion It is commonly said that res judicata only applies if the judgment in the prior action was rendered on the merits of the case. This requirement is deceiving, however, since a party is frequently precluded from relitigating even though she never litigated anything ��on the merits�� in the prior action. The point of the ��on the merits�� requirement is to prevent courts from giving claim preclusive effect to certain procedural dismissals of the first action. For example, if Reynoso sues in federal court, and her case is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no court would bar her from suing on the same claim in state court. She never had a full opportunity to have her case heard in the first action. Indeed, the court�s reason for dismissal was that it could not hear the claim. As we saw at the outset of the chapter, where a legal theory can�t be asserted in the first action, a second action on that theory will not be barred. So dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and similarly, for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, are not viewed as ��on the merits,�� and do not preclude a second action in another court competent to entertain the claim. In other situations, however, dismissals that clearly do not involve litigation of the claim itself do bar a second action, even though we would not think of them as decisions ��on the merits.�� (For this reason, the Second Restatement shies away from the phrase entirely.) If a defendant fails to respond to the suit, for example, and judgment is entered by default for the plaintiff, there has clearly been no litigation on the merits. Yet most courts give res judicata effect to a default judgment. That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the  opportunity  to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing. On the same rationale, a plaintiff who files an action and does not pursue it, leading to a ��dismissal for failure to prosecute,�� will be barred from bringing a second action. If litigation was commenced, and there was no procedural impediment to prevent the court from hearing it, the parties have had their opportunity to litigate and should either grasp it or recognize that they have waived it. In some cases, the parties may reach the merits but not go to trial. For example, a claim may be resolved on summary judgment, when the court finds that there is no dispute of material fact and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Or, a case may be dismissed at the outset for ��failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.�� In both of these situations, the court has concluded that the plaintiff cannot recover, though neither involves a trial. Virtually all courts would give claim preclusive effect to a summary judgment, and a good many treat the dismissal of a case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (or similar state court rules) for failure to state a claim as a bar to a new action. When a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff will be given the opportunity to replead, to try to state a compensable claim for relief. She may also seek to dismiss the action ��without prejudice,�� that is, with express recognition by the court that the dismissal of the first action will not bar another suit on the same claim. If the plaintiff takes neither of these avenues to avoid the demise of her claim, it is probably because she cannot state one. Consider whether the second claim would be barred in the following example.",
            "Question": "5. Procedure and substance.  Akbar sues Rajiv Motors in an Emporia court for injuries suffered while driving a used snowmobile that Rajiv had sold to him. His suit is based on breach of warranty (a contract theory) and strict products liability, a tort theory. Rajiv moves to dismiss the contracts claim, on the ground that the Emporia long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over it. The judge concludes that the long-arm statute allows suit against Rajiv for tort claims, but not contract claims, and dismisses the breach of warranty claim. The case goes to trial on the strict liability claim. After Akbar presents his evidence, the trial judge grants a directed verdict for Rajiv, on the ground that Akbar has not presented sufficient evidence that the snowmobile was defective. Judgment is entered for Rajiv. Later, Akbar sues Rajiv again, for the same injuries, again in the Emporia courts. He bases his claim in this action on a negligence theory.

            "Options": "Options: A.  will be barred, because the negligence claim could have been brought in the first action but was omitted.

D.  will not be barred, since his claim in the second action is not the same claim as his claim in the first.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: To determine whether Akbar's second action will be barred, we need to consider the requirements for claim preclusion under the Second Restatement of Judgments.

Here, the question arises about whether the negligence claim in the second action arose out of the same facts as the breach of warranty and strict product liability claims in the first action.\n\nStep 5: Since the injury occurred due to the sale of a faulty snowmobile, the underlying factual basis for the three different theories of recovery is essentially the same.\n\nStep 6: Now, considering the third prong of the test, we analyze whether there was a final judgment on the merits in the original action. \n\nStep 7: Although the contract claim was dismissed without reaching its merits, the directed verdict dismissing the strict liability claim after presentation of evidence indicates that the court made findings regarding the defectiveness of the snowmobile.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the key factor determining whether the second action will be barred is whether the dismissal of the contract claim constitutes a determination on the merits.",

            "Context": "The ��same parties�� requirement for claim preclusion Although a judgment in a suit against a defendant bars the plaintiff from asserting any further claims against that defendant arising from the same events, it does not bar claims against other actors the plaintiff  might have sued for the same injuries. ��The basic premise of preclusion is that parties to a prior action are bound and nonparties are not bound.�� Wright & Miller �4449. Thus, in the common terminology of claim preclusion, preclusion requires that the parties to the second action be the ��same parties�� as the parties to the first. The simplest example of this involves a plaintiff who sues one defendant for injuries arising from an accident, loses, and then sues another. Generally, this is permissible. Jones, by suing Smith, does not lose the right to sue Doe at another time in another court . . . or at the same time in another court, for that matter. His claims against different defendants are viewed, for claim preclusion purposes, as distinct, so that the assertion of his ��claim�� against Smith does not affect his right to assert his separate ��claim�� against Doe in another action. Similarly, if Jones and Gomez, two passengers in Smith�s car, are injured due to his negligence, each has a separate claim against Smith. If Jones sues for her injuries, and the case goes to judgment, it will not affect Gomez�s right to sue separately for his. The litigation world would be a lot more complicated if res judicata theory did not include this ��same parties�� limitation on the effect of a judgment. If suing one defendant gave rise to a res judicata bar on Jones�s claims against all possible defendants, he would be forced to sue them together in a single action, or lose his claims against the omitted defendants. Jones may not wish to do that, or even be able to do that, due to limits on joinder, personal jurisdiction, or subject matter jurisdiction in the court he prefers. Thus, the ��same parties�� limit appropriately reconciles res judicata theory with the rules on joinder and jurisdiction. Even if a person was a party to a prior action, preclusion may not apply if she was not a direct adversary of another party in the case. Suppose, for example, that Puckett sues Caribe and Ostend, two defendants, in an action arising out of a business deal. He claims that Caribe breached her contract to deliver 50,000 widgets he needed for his business, and that Ostend, the agent who arranged the transaction, misrepresented Caribe�s ability to deliver. Although Caribe and Ostend are codefendants, they are not adversaries. Neither has asserted a claim for relief against the other, and, in fact, they may both be raising the same defenses to Puckett�s claim. Suppose that Puckett loses, because the jury concludes that Caribe had complied with her obligations under the contract. If Ostend had a claim against Caribe for his commission, he would be free to sue Caribe for it in a separate action. Even though he and Caribe were both parties to the prior action, they were not adversaries. Ostend could have asserted a cross-claim for his commission (at least, under Federal Rules practice�see Rule 13(g))�but chose not to. Because his ��claim�� for the commission is not the same as Puckett�s claim against him and Caribe, he could still bring a separate action for his commission against Caribe. There are a few situations in which a nonparty will be bound by a judgment. These usually arise where one of the litigants in the prior action expressly represented the interests of the nonparty. Suppose, for example, that the trustee of a trust sues a bank, claiming that the bank mismanaged the assets of the trust, leading to a loss of value. If the trustee lost, a beneficiary of the trust could not then sue on the same theory. The trustee was empowered to represent the interests of the beneficiaries, and sued on their behalf. Because he litigated on behalf of the beneficiaries, they would be bound. Similarly, legatees of a will would be bound by litigation on their behalf by an executor. On a similar rationale, a buyer of property would be bound by a judgment against the seller. Suppose, for example, that Estrada sued to keep a neighbor from walking across her property to the beach, and the court determined that the neighbor had an easement to do so. A purchaser from Estrada would be bound by that determination of Estrada�s interest in the property, on the theory that Estrada could only convey the interest she actually held. In cases like these, it is held that the represented party is ��in privity�� with the party who sued and therefore bound by the result in the prior litigation. But such situations are rare. In most contexts, one party is not bound by the results in another party�s suit, even if she has a similar interest in establishing liability of a defendant.

Suppose that Higgins agrees to buy a small business from DeVito.

The court finds that DeVito had not misrepresented the income, and refuses to order rescission. After the sale, when Higgins fails to make an installment payment due on the sale, DeVito sues to collect. Higgins now defends again on the ground that the sale is void, because DeVito misrepresented the income of the business. In this example, there is no reason to relitigate the misrepresentation issue. It is the same issue the parties litigated before. The judge heard the evidence and decided the issue in the prior suit.

Area defends on the ground that Cameco, the Area employee who had negotiated the contract, had no authority to bind the company, and that Area had notified O�Hara that it would not honor the agreement. The judge grants summary judgment for O�Hara, finding that Cameco, as a sales agent for Area, had implied authority to enter into the contract. She orders specific performance of the contract. In the third year of the contract, Area again refuses to perform. This time it seeks to avoid the contract by arguing that there was a mutual mistake as to the acreage covered by the contract, because Cameco had not understood that it was to include acreage rented by O�Hara to other farmers.

We know that Renfrow sued Gillespie for negligence after the collision, alleging that Gillespie's negligence caused the accident. However, the outcome of that trial was unfavorable to Renfrow; the jury found for Gillespie.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's consider the current situation where Gillespie brings a claim against Renfrow for damages resulting from the same incident. Renfrow attempts to raise two separate grounds for why Gillespie was negligent: firstly, that Gillespie ran the red light leading up to the crash, and secondly, that Gillespie swerved into Renfrow's vehicle instead of avoiding it.\n\nStep 3: For collateral estoppel to bar Renfrow from presenting these arguments, the issues raised in the second action must be identical to those already adjudicated in the initial proceeding. This means examining whether the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each alleged act of negligence—running the red light versus swerving into another vehicle—are sufficiently similar to warrant application of collateral estoppel.\n\nStep 4: Given that the original lawsuit focused solely on whether Gillespie's actions constituted negligence at all, without specifying particular behaviors such as running a red light or swerving, it seems unlikely that every possible aspect of Gillespie’s behavior could be considered part of the ‘issue’ previously decided upon.\n\n\nStep 5: Furthermore, even though Renfrow may argue that he has new evidence regarding Gillespie’s running of the red light, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the issue itself isn't 'the same' - especially considering that both cases involve allegations of Gillespie being careless with traffic signals.\n\n\n\nStep 6: On the other hand, the allegation about Gillespie swerving into Renfrow appears distinct enough from the general charge of negligence initially brought forth during the first trial. Since this specific detail wasn't directly addressed within the scope of the preceding proceedings, applying principles related to full faith & credit suggests allowing Renfrow some leeway here.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Therefore, given our understanding of what constitutes an “identical” issue under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, along with considerations tied to fairness and judicial efficiency, it follows logically that Renfrow shouldn't face complete preclusion from making certain points in support of his position.\n\n\n\n---",

            "Context": "The ��necessary to the judgment�� requirement Necessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp. This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let�s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey , 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well.  What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria�s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn�t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria�s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for  his  injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn�t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey�s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in  Cambria v. Jeffrey  held that Jeffrey could  litigate it again, because the judge�s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not ��necessary to the judgment.��  What finding  was  necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it�s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because  he  (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win,  whether the defendant was negligent or not . Thus, Cambria�s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn�t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can�t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that  leads to  the judgment in the case. There�s another problem with findings that don�t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable:  Put yourself in Jeffrey�s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries.  If Jeffrey appealed the judge�s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, ��What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn�t change the outcome, so why should we  waste  our  time  reviewing  an  irrelevant conclusion?�� And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn�t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey�s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge�s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can�t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that  do  affect the outcome, that are ��necessary to the judgment.�� Consider this case.",

            "Context": "The cases we�ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of ��mutual collateral estoppel,�� because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the ��mutuality�� doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is  Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore , 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel,  all courts  adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn�t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used  against  a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here�s a case that makes the point.",

Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall�s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall�s, that Faithful�s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent.

            "Context": "A taste of ��non-mutual�� collateral estoppel. The cases we�ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of ��mutual collateral estoppel,�� because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the ��mutuality�� doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is  Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore , 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel,  all courts  adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn�t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used  against  a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here�s a case that makes the point.",
            "Question": "11. Investment in litigation. Gotschall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc. on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that the brochure fraudulently promised a 15 percent rate of return on his investment. He also alleged that his contract with Faithful agreed to return his money after one year if the fund had not made a profit during the year, which Faithful had subsequently refused to do. Faithful denied both claims. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the contract did not guarantee any particular rate of return. However, she also found that the contract did provide for a refund at the close of the first year if there had not been a profit. The court entered judgment awarding no damages to Gotschall for misrepresentation, but ordering return of his original investment. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, learned of the action and sued Faithful for breach of contract and fraud, raising the same two claims that Gotschall had asserted in his suit. Faithful raised the same defenses. Under federal collateral estoppel principles, the court would probably",
            "Options": "Options: A. bar Carmichael from relitigating either issue, based on issue preclusion, since the same issues were already litigated and decided in Gotschall�s action.\nB. allow Carmichael to relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, since Carmichael has not litigated that issue.\nC. allow Faithful to relitigate whether the contract provided for a refund after one year, because they have not litigated that issue against Carmichael.\nD. require Carmichael to relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, because the finding in Faithful�s favor on that issue was not necessary to the judgment in the prior action.",
            "legal_reasoning": "Step 1: First, let's analyze the given scenario. We have three entities - Gotschall, Faithful Investments Inc., and Carmichael. Gotschall initially sued Faithful in federal court over fraudulent promises regarding returns on investments and refusal to return funds according to their agreement. \n\nStep 2: The court ruled in favor of Gotschall on the latter claim, stating that the contract indeed allowed for refunds within a specified timeframe, but dismissed the former due to lack of evidence supporting the promise of specific returns.\n\nStep 3: Now, Carmichael wants to sue Faithful for similar reasons, claiming breach of contract and fraud. Since these issues were already addressed in Gotschall’s lawsuit, we need to determine how this affects Carmichael’s ability to bring up these points.\n\nStep 4: According to the principle of issue preclusion, once an issue has been fully and finally adjudicated in a prior proceeding, it cannot be re-litigated in subsequent proceedings unless certain exceptions apply.\n\nStep 5: Given that the issues of contractual terms and potential fraud were directly addressed in Gotschall’s lawsuit, we must consider whether Carmichael can avoid the effects of issue preclusion.\n\n\nStep 6: To decide this question, we look at the requirements for applying issue preclusion. Specifically, we examine whether the party seeking to assert the earlier decision (Faithful) was a party to the initial lawsuit where the issue was resolved (Gotschall vs. Faithful).\n\nStep 7: If Faithful was a party to the initial lawsuit, then issue preclusion applies, meaning that Carmichael cannot raise the same arguments about contractual terms and potential fraud.\n\nStep 8: Based on our understanding of issue preclusion, we find that Faithful was indeed a defendant in Gotschall’s lawsuit, making them subject to the application of issue preclusion.",
