            "Context": "State citizenship in diversity cases: The domicile test Under federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000. The state citizenship of a person\ufffdas opposed to that of a corporation\ufffdis determined by her domicile, that is, the most recent state where she has (1) resided with (2) the intent to remain indefinitely. The \ufffd\ufffdresidence\ufffd\ufffd requirement is easily satisfied. Staying overnight in a hotel or a tent will establish \ufffd\ufffdresidence\ufffd\ufffd in a state. It is the intent-to-remain-indefinitely prong that gives students problems. A person intends to remain indefinitely in a state if she is residing in the state on an open-ended basis, without the intent to leave at a definite time or on the occurrence of a definite event. You don\ufffdt have to swear allegiance forever to a state to acquire domicile there; you only need to reside there \ufffd\ufffdindefinitely,\ufffd\ufffd that is, on an open-ended basis. If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her \ufffd\ufffdhome.\ufffd\ufffd She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn\ufffdt acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn\ufffdt plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn\ufffdt acquired one in New York either, since he doesn\ufffdt reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite \ufffd\ufffdindefinite\ufffd\ufffd intent.",
            "Question": "1. Moving Marla.  Marla, who grew up in Montana, moved to Colorado after high school to enter a two-year program for hair stylists at the Denver Beauty School. She wasn\ufffdt sure if she really wanted to be a stylist, but she was anxious to get away from home, and her parents agreed to foot the bill, so off she went. She figured she\ufffdd stay if she liked it, and get a job as a stylist afterwards, in Denver or elsewhere in the West (including Montana). Or she would leave the program if she didn\ufffdt like it and look for work, hopefully in Denver. She took an apartment on a six-month lease. After moving to Denver, Marla",
            "Options": "Options: A.  remains domiciled in Montana, because the program is only for two years. B.  remains domiciled in Montana, because she may return there to work as a stylist. C.  remains domiciled in Montana, because she was domiciled there before she left for Denver. D.  is domiciled in Colorado, because she resides there with the intent to remain indefinitely.",
            "Analysis": "Don\ufffdt be fooled by  A . Although Marla\ufffds program is for two years, that doesn\ufffdt mean that Marla will be there  only  for two years. The question indicates that she might stay in Denver after finishing the program, or she might leave for a job in some other Western state. Or, she might leave the program if she doesn\ufffdt like it and stay in Denver. Thus, she may leave Colorado, or she may not. Since she is not definitely planning to leave Colorado at the end of the program, her stay is not clearly limited to the two years of her academic program. How about  B ? It sounds seductively reasonable. But the test for domicile isn\ufffdt whether you might someday go back to the state from which you came. The test is your attitude toward the state where you are. If you live in a state indefinitely, you acquire domicile there, even if you think you might go somewhere else, or back where you came from, at some point in the future. Here, Marla\ufffds state of mind is that, whether she finishes the program or not, she may stay in Colorado, or she may leave. That certainly does not show an intent to leave at a definite time. She is in the state with no definite plans to leave. The possibility that Marla might move on at some time in the future does not make her current stay a \ufffd\ufffddefinite\ufffd\ufffd one. She might leave Colorado, or she might not. That\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdindefinite\ufffd\ufffd intent. C  would only be right if Marla has not established a new domicile in Colorado. If she went to Denver for a fixed period, she would retain her Montana domicile. However, if she\ufffds in Denver without definite plans to leave, she establishes a new domicile there. The facts suggest that her stay is open-ended, so she has established a Colorado domicile.  D  takes the prize.",

            "Context": "The difference between intent and evidence: Proof of domicile Cases analyzing domicile for purposes of diversity frequently cite evidence about the person\ufffds practical affairs, in order to establish a party\ufffds intent. The court may rely on facts such as where the party votes, has health insurance, has a driver\ufffds license, rents an apartment, has a bank account, registers her car, and so forth. Certainly, such facts are relevant evidence of a person\ufffds intent to remain in a state, or not to. But keep in mind that the  test itself  is the person\ufffds intent. Evidence about her practical affairs may help to demonstrate her subjective intent, but a person is not automatically domiciled where she has an apartment, or votes, or maintains her health insurance. If she were,  that would be the test,  rather than her subjective intent. Parties introduce such practical evidence about a person\ufffds conduct to prove the ultimately relevant fact: her intent. But a person could be domiciled in Wisconsin, even though most of these practical factors point to Illinois. It\ufffds all a matter of trying to ascertain a subjective fact based on all the evidence. A court will certainly look at the party\ufffds testimony in assessing intent, but will also consider whether her practical conduct corroborates or refutes that testimony.",
            "Question": "2. Wedding plans.  Rossi grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. In August 2017, she departed for college in Idaho. After starting school in Idaho, she registered her car there and established a bank account there. She gets health coverage through the college. She has an apartment there, which she has taken on a one-year lease. She has a part-time job in Idaho, and has Idaho state taxes taken out of her check. On her application for the job she listed her Idaho address and telephone number. Her plan is to complete a two-year computer technician degree, and then return to Pennsylvania, where her fiancee has just taken over his family\ufffds construction business in Erie. (They have reserved a hall for their wedding in June 2019.) However, she may need a bit more than two years to finish the degree, if tuition goes up too much. Three months after arriving in Idaho, Rossi brings suit against a Pennsylvania surgeon, for an injury suffered in an operation performed in Pennsylvania a year before. She sues in federal court on the basis of diversity. The court will probably conclude that Rossi is domiciled in",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Pennsylvania, since she is only in Idaho as a student. B.  Pennsylvania, since she intends to return to Pennsylvania when she finishes her degree. C.  Idaho, since she has an apartment there, goes to school there, has a job there, has health coverage there and pays Idaho state taxes on her income. D.  Idaho, since she doesn\ufffdt know when she will finish the college program. E.  Idaho, if she testifies in her deposition that she plans to remain there indefinitely.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds start with  C , which suggests that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho because she has an apartment there, an Idaho job, health insurance there, and so on. The example illustrates a situation in which most of these practical facts suggest that one state is the domicile, but it probably isn\ufffdt. Here, there are good reasons for Rossi to arrange her practical affairs as she has, even if she plans to leave Idaho. If you went to school in a state, wouldn\ufffdt you need a place to live? Wouldn\ufffdt you get a job if you needed money? Wouldn\ufffdt you give your local address so the employer could get in touch with you? Wouldn\ufffdt you join the college health plan? Very likely, you would do all of these things, whether you intended to leave the state when you finished the degree or not. In this case, there\ufffds a perfectly good explanation for all these practical choices, even if Rossi has definite plans to leave the state. So, these facts do not themselves establish that Rossi has an open-ended commitment to living in Idaho. So  C  is wrong. D  suggests that Rossi is domiciled in Idaho, because she doesn\ufffdt know exactly when she will finish her degree. However, while Rossi doesn\ufffdt know when she will finish, she does have definite plans to leave Idaho when she does. Since she plans to leave upon the occurrence of a particular event, her stay is not open-ended. She\ufffds an Idaho visitor, not a domiciliary, under domicile analysis. But  A  isn\ufffdt right either. It implies that you can never establish a domicile by going to a state as a student. That isn\ufffdt so. If you go to a state to attend school, without definite plans beyond your studies, you can establish a domicile there. Many students do satisfy the reside-with- intent-to-remain-indefinitely test by going to school. A case in point, on which this example is very loosely based, is  Gordon v. Steele,  376 F. Supp. 575 (W.D. Pa. 1974). How about  E , which takes the position that the court will find Rossi domiciled in Idaho if she testifies that she plans to remain there indefinitely? Would this be dispositive? Surely not. People do sometimes lie. More often, some motive, such as access to federal court, may color their view of a subjective fact. In determining Rossi\ufffds domicile, the court would look at all the evidence, not just her testimony. Here, the facts pointing to Idaho are easily explained on another basis. And the fact that her fiancee has taken over the family business and they plan to marry at the time she will likely complete her studies very strongly suggests that she intends to return. Her testimony is important evidence about her intent, but not solely dispositive. So  B  is the best answer. Rossi has not established a domicile in Idaho, because she went there with clear plans to leave when she finished her degree. The question  tells you  that she plans to leave, and her engagement clearly corroborates her intent to go back to Erie. So the point is that the practical factors may be useful in evaluating a person\ufffds subjective intent. But the ultimate fact to be proved, under the domicile test, is the intent itself.",

These actions are considered relevant evidence of intent (QC 2).\n\nStep 2: While Rossi intends to return to Pennsylvania after completing her degree (QC 4, QC 5), this future intention does not automatically negate her current domicile.  The determining factor is her present intent (QC 1).\n\nStep 3:  The fact that Rossi's stay in Idaho might extend beyond two years (QC 4) does not automatically change her domicile.

The court will consider all evidence, including her testimony, but her practical conduct is highly relevant (QC 2).\n\nStep 5:  Option E is incorrect because while testimony is considered, it is not the sole determinant.  The totality of the evidence is key (QC 2). Options A and B are incorrect because they disregard the significant evidence of Rossi's life in Idaho (QC 3). Option D is incorrect because the uncertainty of the degree completion time does not override the evidence of her current domicile. Option C accurately reflects that the totality of Rossi's actions in Idaho (QC 3) strongly suggests her current domicile is in Idaho, even considering her future plans (QC 4, QC 5).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the court will likely conclude that Rossi is domiciled in Idaho (C) based on the preponderance of evidence indicating her present intent to reside there.\n\n\nFinal Answer: C\n"

            "Context": "Chief Justice Marshall\ufffds  Strawbridge  Rule: The requirement of complete diversity Very early on, the Supreme Court held that diversity jurisdiction is only proper if all plaintiffs are citizens of different states from all defendants. Strawbridge v. Curtiss , 7 U.S. 267 (1806). You can have multiple defendants from the same state, and multiple plaintiffs from the same state, but no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant or her presence will \ufffd\ufffddestroy diversity.\ufffd\ufffd (In the real world, of course, a plaintiff can cure the defect by dropping the nondiverse plaintiff, or a defendant from the plaintiff\ufffds state, to \ufffd\ufffdperfect diversity.\ufffd\ufffd) A twist in applying the  Strawbridge  rule arises in cases involving corporations. The Supreme Court has held that corporations are state \ufffd\ufffdcitizens,\ufffd\ufffd but courts cannot determine their citizenship by the domicile test, since a corporation can\ufffdt have \ufffd\ufffdintent\ufffd\ufffd the way a person can. Consequently, Congress has defined the \ufffd\ufffdstate citizenship\ufffd\ufffd of a corporation in the diversity statute itself. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated, and also the state in which it has its principal place of business.",
            "Question": "3. Foundering fathers.  In which of the following cases would the federal court  lack diversity jurisdiction? (Assume in each case that the suit is for more than $75,000.)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Madison, from Virginia, Jefferson, from Virginia, and Gerry, from Massachusetts, sue Hamilton, from New York and Franklin, from Pennsylvania. B.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Lafayette, from Maryland, and Washington Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Maryland, and a large office in Virginia. C.  Madison, from Virginia, sues Adams Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Virginia. D.  The court lacks jurisdiction in choices  B  and  C .",
            "Analysis": "Questions with double choices, like  D  here, can be excruciating. You review the answers and find one that is \ufffd\ufffdright.\ufffd\ufffd You think you\ufffdre all set, and then realize that you aren\ufffdt, since two may be right. Back to the drawing board. One lesson, of course, is to read all the choices very carefully. A  is a proper diversity case (and therefore not the right answer) since no defendant is from the same state as any plaintiff.  C  is not a proper diversity case, since Adams Corporation is from the same state as Madison: Its principal place of business is in Virginia. Adams can\ufffdt argue that there\ufffds diversity because it is from Delaware, where it is incorporated. The point of 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1) is that the corporation is considered a citizen of  both  states, and is not diverse from a citizen of either. So we have one right answer. The tougher question is whether there is diversity jurisdiction in  B , in which Washington Corporation is not incorporated in Madison\ufffds state, and does not have its principal place of business there, but does have a substantial place of business there. The statute provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state of \ufffd\ufffdthe\ufffd\ufffd principal place of business, suggesting that only one will be chosen, even if the corporation has large establishments in several. That has been the holding of the courts. A corporation\ufffdsay, McDonalds, of hamburger fame\ufffdmay have many restaurants and a great deal of business in lots of states, but under \ufffd1332(c)(1) the court must choose one as its \ufffd\ufffdprincipal\ufffd\ufffd place of business. The question tells you that Washington Corporation\ufffds principal place of business is Maryland. It can\ufffdt be diverse from a Marylander, but is diverse from Virginians. So  B is a good diversity case; the right answer is  C . By the way, this question suggests two useful hints about taking multiple-choice questions. \ufffd First, read the question with excruciating care. Here, it would be easy to read the question as \ufffd\ufffdIn which cases would the court  have jurisdiction?\ufffd\ufffd If you do, of course, you will get it wrong. In a lecture by an expert on the multistate bar exam (which consists solely of multiple-choice questions) the speaker described the multistate exam as \ufffd\ufffdan exercise in reading comprehension.\ufffd\ufffd I would be willing to wager that most students get more questions wrong by failing to read carefully than they do from lack of substantive knowledge. \ufffd Second, when a question tells you something is true, take it on faith. Here, for example, don\ufffdt go questioning whether Washington Corporation\ufffds large office in Virginia might be its principal place of business. Your professor is the boss in the artificial world of the exam. If she says its principal place of business is Maryland, answer the question based on that premise, whether you believe it or not.",

            "Context": "Determining a corporation\ufffds principal place of business Congress has provided that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state of its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1). So, to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule to corporate parties to a diversity case, courts have to determine where a corporation\ufffds principal place of business is. Corporations conduct their business in many different ways. Most corporations are small, and are incorporated in one state and do all their business in that state. These corporations are citizens of only one state. But large corporations might have extensive activities in many states\ufffdthink Home Depot, or McDonalds. And some corporations will incorporate in one state, concentrate their manufacturing activities in another, and maintain their headquarters, where the corporation\ufffds high-level decisions are made, in a third. Until 2010, federal courts took several approaches to determining a corporation\ufffds principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1). Some held that the state of a corporation\ufffds headquarters is the state of its principal place of business, even if the corporation\ufffds manufacturing or service activities took place elsewhere. Other courts, however, applied a \ufffd\ufffddaily activities\ufffd\ufffd test if a corporation\ufffds productive activities were primarily concentrated in a single state, reasoning that the corporation will be perceived as \ufffd\ufffdlocal\ufffd\ufffd in that state, since it will have the most contact with the public there. If the productive activities were widely spread among states, these courts would look to the state where the corporation has its headquarters or \ufffd\ufffdnerve center,\ufffd\ufffd since the diffused activities would all be coordinated from that state. All of this is now interesting history, because in 2010 the Supreme Court held, in  Hertz Corp. v. Friend,  559 U.S. 77 (2010), that the corporation\ufffds principal place of business for diversity purposes is the state of its headquarters in all cases. After  Hertz , a corporation is citizen of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties.",
            "Question": "5. Business principals.

Apex is a corporation that manufactures lawnmowers. It is incorporated in Delaware. It assembles the mowers at its plant in El Paso, Texas, which employs five hundred employees. It has another factory in Tennessee, which manufactures handles for the mowers and employs twenty-five employees. Its corporate headquarters occupy a small suite of offices on the twelfth floor of an office building in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fifteen officers and employees work out of the headquarters office.

There is something so  plausible  about it, isn\ufffdt there? The suit is brought in the state where the plaintiffs live, so no diversity? Of course this doesn\ufffdt make sense, but it threatens to distract you from the business at hand. To determine diversity, we compare the state citizenship of the plaintiffs and the defendants, not the plaintiffs\ufffd citizenship and the place where the suit is brought. If the parties are from different states, it does not matter that one of the parties is a citizen of the state in which the suit is brought. The case is a proper diversity case,  no matter what state the suit is brought in. C  should not fool any but the truly unprepared. Under  Strawbridge v. Curtiss , you can have a hundred plaintiffs from the same state, as long as no defendant is from that state. So the fact that both plaintiffs are from Texas does not defeat diversity jurisdiction. And you should have rejected  E  quickly as well. A corporation is a citizen of  both  its state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business, so we need to determine that here in order to apply the  Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. D  is beguiling, because it would make a lot of sense for a court to treat Apex as local in the state where its daily productive activity is centered. Many courts did apply this approach before the Supreme Court decided  Hertz Corp. v. Friend . But that case is a Supreme Court case; its decisions are the supreme law of the land, and in  Hertz  the Court held that a corporation\ufffds principal place of business for diversity purposes is in the state where it has its central offices\ufffdits headquarters from which it directs corporate operations.

Citizens or Subjects\ufffd\ufffd (sometimes called \ufffd\ufffdaliens\ufffd\ufffd). So, a case between a citizen of Oregon and a citizen of Spain is within the constitutional grant of federal subject matter jurisdiction in Article III, \ufffd2. And, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(a)(2) provides statutory authority for the federal district courts to hear such cases. By extrapolation, courts have held that a case between citizens of different states, with an alien added as an additional plaintiff or defendant, is also proper. See 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(a)(3). However, interpretive questions arise when an alien is domiciled in one of the American states. Suppose, for example, that Frankel, a New Yorker, sues Leduc, a citizen of France living in New York. The courts have held that there is federal jurisdiction over this case, since Leduc, though living in the plaintiff\ufffds state, is a foreign national (an alien).

Since Leduc is a French citizen, he cannot be a citizen of New York, even if he is domiciled there. To be a New York citizen, a person must both be domiciled in New York and a citizen of the  United States . The diversity statute has a special provision, however, that changes the result in Leduc\ufffds case if he has been \ufffd\ufffdadmitted for permanent residence in the United States.\ufffd\ufffd Section 1332(a)(2) now provides that an alien admitted for permanent residence and domiciled in a state cannot bring a diversity action against a citizen of the state in which she is domiciled. Leduc is thus treated as \ufffd\ufffdlocal\ufffd\ufffd in his state of domicile if he is here as a permanent resident. However, if Leduc has not been admitted for permanent residence (which apparently equates under immigration law to having a \ufffd\ufffdgreen card\ufffd\ufffd), Frankel could sue him in federal court under \ufffd1332(a)(2). Conversely, a person may be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of any state. If Frankel moves to Gambia and establishes a domicile there, he is still a United States citizen, but he is not a citizen of any American state, since he isn\ufffdt domiciled in one. However, he isn\ufffdt an alien either, as long as he remains an American citizen. So the diversity jurisdiction doesn\ufffdt apply. This problem arose in  Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Taylor , 239 F. Supp. 913 (D.C.N.Y. 1965). Twentieth Century Fox sued Elizabeth Taylor for her shenanigans during filming of the movie \ufffd\ufffdCleopatra.\ufffd\ufffd Although Taylor was an American citizen, she was living\ufffdindefinitely\ufffdin England. Consequently, she was not domiciled in any state and could not be sued in federal court based on diversity. She wasn\ufffdt an alien, since she had not renounced her American citizenship. Nor was she a citizen of any American state, since she was domiciled in Great Britain.",
            "Question": "6. At home and abroad.  Crandall, a citizen of Missouri, and Rizzouti, a citizen of Iowa, sue Janssen, a citizen of Vermont; Gompers, an American citizen who lived all his life in Florida but recently moved to Great Britain and plans to remain indefinitely; and Toussaint, a Frenchwoman who has moved to Iowa to take a one-year visiting professorship at the University of Iowa, hoping to get tenure there and stay. The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. (Assume that Toussaint has not been admitted to the United States for \ufffd\ufffdpermanent residence.\ufffd\ufffd)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  There is no jurisdiction over the action because Toussaint is a citizen of Iowa. B.  There is no jurisdiction if Gompers remains in the case, but the action could proceed between the plaintiffs Crandall and Rizzouti and defendants Toussaint and Janssen. C.  There is no jurisdiction over the claims against Toussaint, because she is an alien domiciled in Iowa. D.  There is jurisdiction over the entire action.",
            "Analysis": "This question should help to sort out the complexities of applying diversity to cases involving American citizens and aliens. The crux of the problem is the point made above: To be a \ufffd\ufffdcitizen\ufffd\ufffd for diversity purposes, you must be  both  a citizen of the United States and domiciled in a state. Here, Toussaint, while domiciled in Iowa, is not a citizen of Iowa, because she isn\ufffdt an American citizen. She\ufffds a French national, and therefore, under Article III, \ufffd2, she is an alien (\ufffd\ufffda citizen or subject of a foreign country\ufffd\ufffd). (The exception in \ufffd1332(a)(2) does not apply, because Toussaint has not been admitted for permanent residence.) So  A  is wrong. C  is wrong, too. Article III authorizes suits between citizens of a state (or, as here, of several states) and aliens. It is irrelevant that Toussaint is domiciled in Iowa; she remains a Frenchwoman until she becomes an American citizen (or is admitted for permanent residence, under \ufffd1332(a)(2)). And  D  is wrong, because Gompers is not a citizen of any state. Remember that, to be a citizen of a state you must be both an American citizen and domiciled in a state. Gompers is an American citizen, but he isn\ufffdt domiciled in any state, since he is living in Great Britain with the intent to remain there indefinitely. The claim against him would have to be dropped for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Consequently, go with B .",

            "Context": "The relation between statutory diversity jurisdiction and the constitutional grant Article III, \ufffd2 of the Constitution creates diversity jurisdiction in very general terms. It does not expressly state whether there must be \ufffd\ufffdcomplete diversity,\ufffd\ufffd or whether diversity might be satisfied if  some plaintiffs are diverse from  some  defendants.  Strawbridge v.

But it  could be  changed by Congress. Recall that the jurisdiction allowed under the Constitution is not self-executing. The lower federal courts derive their jurisdiction from Congress. Congress may authorize jurisdiction over all cases described in Article III, or it may authorize the federal district courts to hear only some subset of those cases.

            "Analysis": "It\ufffds crucial to understand why  D  is wrong. Article III of the Constitution doesn\ufffdt create federal district courts, and doesn\ufffdt directly bestow any jurisdiction on them. Section 1 of Article III authorizes Congress  to create lower federal courts if it chooses to. This power to create lower federal courts (or not to) carries with it the implied authority to create them, but to authorize them to hear only some of the cases listed in Article III, \ufffd2. See  Kline v. Burke Constr. Inc.,  260 U.S. 226, 233-234 (1922). In other words, Article III, \ufffd2 defines the universe of cases that federal courts may potentially hear, but Congress creates the lower federal courts and can give them as much or as little of the Article III jurisdiction as it chooses to. It need not\ufffdand never has\ufffdbestowed all of the constitutionally permissible jurisdiction on the lower federal courts. So  D  is wrong because Article III does not directly grant jurisdiction to the federal district courts; Congress does.  A  is wrong too, because Congress cannot give the lower federal courts any jurisdiction it wants. It may only grant jurisdiction over cases within the categories listed in Article III, \ufffd2, which defines the outer limits of the federal judicial power. And  B  is also wrong, because  Strawbridge,  we now know (from the  Tashire  decision), interpreted the federal diversity statute, not Article III, \ufffd2. Since it is the statute, \ufffd1332(a) (as interpreted by  Strawbridge ), that requires complete diversity, Congress could change it. Ironically, of course, it was really Chief Justice Marshall who established the complete diversity requirement, in  Strawbridge.  But he interpreted the diversity statute to require complete diversity, not the Constitution, and the statute may be changed by Congress. So don\ufffdt blame Marshall alone for the rule; Congress hasn\ufffdt changed it in two hundred years. Thus,  C  is right. Smith\ufffds bill would authorize jurisdiction based on \ufffd\ufffdminimal diversity.\ufffd\ufffd Tashire  holds that \ufffd\ufffdminimal diversity\ufffd\ufffd cases are proper diversity cases, within the meaning of Article III, \ufffd2, so Congress could authorize federal district courts to hear them.",

            "Context": "One problem with requiring a minimum amount in controversy is that you have to know how much is \ufffd\ufffdin controversy\ufffd\ufffd in order to determine whether the court has jurisdiction. Courts generally determine their jurisdiction at the outset of a case, but how can they determine the amount in dispute between the parties without gathering evidence or trying the case? The Supreme Court addressed this conundrum in  St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co.,  303 U.S. 283 (1938). Under the \ufffd\ufffd St. Paul Mercury  rule,\ufffd\ufffd the court will find the amount requirement met as long as it is possible that the plaintiff\ufffds claim would support a recovery of more than $75,000. If the judge, evaluating the plaintiff\ufffds injuries or damages, concludes that a jury would likely award more than $75,000, she will find the amount requirement met. If she concludes that a jury probably would award less than $75,000, but  might  rationally award more, she would still find the amount requirement met. If, on the other hand, she concludes that a verdict over $75,000 would be irrational, that the claim is \ufffd\ufffdto a legal certainty\ufffd\ufffd worth less than the amount required, she would dismiss for failure to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement. This approach gives the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt. Where her damages might exceed the required number, the amount requirement is deemed satisfied, and the case may go forward in federal court. It is only where her injuries or losses could not rationally support a verdict for the jurisdictional amount that her claim will be dismissed. Here\ufffds a question that probes the application of the  St. Paul Mercury rule.",
            "Question": "9.  St. Paul  misery.  Wanda brings a diversity action against Peroski in federal court for injuries suffered in a construction accident. As a result of the accident, Wanda suffered a badly sprained ankle. She alleges that Peroski\ufffds negligence caused the accident. However, Peroski denies that her conduct was negligent. Wanda demands $100,000 in damages for her injuries.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will consider whether Wanda is likely to be able to prove that Peroski was negligent. B.  To determine whether the amount-in-controversy requirement is met, the court will have to determine whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for the injuries Wanda alleges. C.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met if it is clear, to a legal certainty, that Wanda\ufffds damages exceed $75,000. D.  The amount-in-controversy requirement is met, because Wanda seeks $100,000 in damages.",
            "Analysis": "If  D  were the right answer to this question, the amount-in- controversy requirement would be a dead letter. Plaintiffs would simply demand large damages in their complaints, and the federal court would have to hear their cases. Surely, federal judges are too savvy to leave it at that. The court won\ufffdt simply accept the number Wanda\ufffds lawyer asks for in damages; it will look at  the actual injury Wanda has suffered,  and consider whether those injuries could rationally support a verdict over the required amount. The rule suggested by  C  also misperceives the meaning of the  St. Paul Mercury  test. It suggests that the amount requirement is only satisfied where the plaintiff will definitely recover more than $75,000. Under this test, if the plaintiff might recover more, but also might recover less, there would be no diversity jurisdiction. Under  St. Paul Mercury,  the presumption is the opposite: if the damages are in the debatable range, where a reasonable jury might award more, or might award less, the amount requirement is met. Only where it is clear, as a matter of law, that the award will be  less  is the amount requirement not met. A  can\ufffdt be right either: The amount-in-controversy question is not whether the plaintiff is likely to win her case on the merits, but whether, if  she does,  she might recover more than $75,000. After all, \ufffd1332(a) requires that more than $75,000 must be \ufffd\ufffdin controversy,\ufffd\ufffd not actually recovered. If the court had to consider the strength of the plaintiff\ufffds proof of her claim in order to decide whether the amount-in-controversy requirement was met, it would not be able to decide this preliminary issue without developing the facts through discovery and litigating the merits of the case. That would be a poor rule indeed for a question of jurisdiction, which should be settled at the outset of the case. So  B  is the best answer. The court will look at Wanda\ufffds damages, a sprained ankle, and consider whether a reasonable jury could award more than $75,000 for that injury.

            "Context": "Aggregation of damages in diversity cases If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \ufffd\ufffdaggregation\ufffd\ufffd problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \ufffd\ufffdaggregate\ufffd\ufffd claims against  different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \ufffd\ufffdcommon, undivided interest.\ufffd\ufffd (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at  Chapter 14 , pp.  279 - 283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.",

The courts have generally taken the position that Maurice must seek more than $75,000 against Parker to meet the amount requirement. 2  He can\ufffdt bootstrap a claim against Parker for less than the required amount onto his claim against O\ufffdConnell for more. And  B  is wrong, because the aggregation rules don\ufffdt allow aggregation of amounts sought against different defendants. A  is correct.

            "Context": "Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\ufffds fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\ufffds fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \ufffd\ufffdjointly and severally liable\ufffd\ufffd for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \ufffd\ufffdin controversy\ufffd\ufffd between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000.",

He further claims that Dr. Moe negligently set the leg after the accident, causing an additional $30,000 in damages.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds dispose of Larry, Moe, and Curly, and then we\ufffdll move on to other matters. The last choice,  D , is the most interesting here, but it isn\ufffdt the right answer. Under the law of causation in tort law, Curly would probably be liable for the $60,000 in initial injuries to Larry and the additional $30,000 due to Dr. Moe\ufffds malpractice. Larry would not have suffered the malpractice if he had not been injured in the accident, so most jurisdictions would hold Curly liable for this additional loss as well as the broken leg. So, the amount requirement is met as to him. But Dr. Moe is only liable for the $30,000 in damages that he caused, so the amount requirement is not met as to him. And Larry cannot aggregate his claim against Dr. Moe with his claim against Curly. Under the traditional aggregation rules, the plaintiff must seek more than $75,000 from each defendant. And that rule has not been changed by 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute. See 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(b) (barring supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Fed. R. Civ. P. 20). A  isn\ufffdt right because the amount requirement is not met by either plaintiff, and they can\ufffdt be added together.  B  is no good either. The amount requirement must be assessed based only on the plaintiff\ufffds claim, without regard to the value of any counterclaim. If Curly had brought the initial suit (and the claim for $100,000 were colorable), the court would have had jurisdiction. But Larry brought it, and sues for less, so his claim does not support original jurisdiction. The claims in  C  do satisfy the amount requirement, however. Here, either defendant might be found to have negligently caused Larry\ufffds injuries, so either might be liable for his full $100,000 in damages. Go with  C .",

Larry's claim ($60,000) plus Moe's claim ($25,000) equals $85,000, which exceeds the jurisdictional amount.

            "Context": "The toughest nut: The  Mottley  rule The most fundamental point about arising-under jurisdiction is that many cases that involve federal issues do not \ufffd\ufffdarise under\ufffd\ufffd federal law. This is the essential message of that civil procedure chestnut,  Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley,  211 U.S. 149 (1908). In  Mottley , the plaintiffs sued the railroad for breach of contract, and alleged in their complaint that the railroad had breached the contract because it believed that a federal statute prohibited it from renewing their passes for free travel. In fact, when it answered the complaint, the railroad did rely on the federal statute as their justification for denying the passes. The parties then litigated that federal question and the federal trial court held that the federal statute did not bar renewing the passes. The United States Supreme Court reversed and ordered the case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court held that a case only \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd federal law, within the meaning of the federal statute granting arising-under jurisdiction, if the  plaintiff relies  on federal law as the source of her right to relief. That wasn\ufffdt true in  Mottley : the plaintiffs had sued for breach of contract, a state law claim. Although a federal issue was litigated, because the railroad raised a defense based on federal law, the plaintiffs did not base their claim on federal law. The fundamental premise of the  Mottley  rule is that we must assess the federal court\ufffds subject matter jurisdiction based on the plaintiff\ufffds complaint. There is no inherent reason why this must be so. Presumably, the court could wait to see whether the defendant\ufffds answer raises defenses based in federal law, or asserts a counterclaim under federal law, and allow the court to hear the case if she does. Such later pleadings may inject important federal issues into the case, as they did in  Mottley. There\ufffds a good argument that this would be a sensible interpretation of the arising-under statute. Indeed, the American Law Institute recommended some years ago that removal be authorized where the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a federal law defense. See American Law Institute, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts, \ufffd1312(a)(2) (1969). But Mottley  is still good law in the federal courts. Here\ufffds a fairly straightforward question that illustrates the point.",
            "Question": "1. Making a federal case.  Consolidated Corporation sues Garces, a former employee, for business libel, a tort claim. The suit is brought in federal court, and alleges that Garces falsely reported to a federal agency that Consolidated was using watered-down concrete on a federal construction project. Garces answers, admitting that he had made a report to the agency, but alleging that his report was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right of free speech. He also files a counterclaim against Consolidated, based on the Federal Whistleblower Act, which authorizes damages for anyone who is dismissed or disciplined for reporting fraud on the federal government. After answering the complaint, Garces moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Assume that there is no jurisdiction based on diversity.) The motion should be",

E.  denied, because Garces waived his objection to jurisdiction by answering the complaint and asserting a counterclaim against Consolidated.",
            "Analysis": "While it might make sense to allow federal jurisdiction whenever an issue of federal law is raised in a suit, this has not been the Supreme Court\ufffds interpretation of the arising-under statute. Under Mottley,  we don\ufffdt consider federal questions injected into the case by the defendant. Consequently,  C  is wrong; the fact that the case  involves  a federal question isn\ufffdt enough to satisfy  Mottley.  We need to look at the plaintiff\ufffds claim only. Here, the law that creates Consolidated\ufffds right to sue is libel law, which is state tort law; the federal law issue only enters the case as a defense. D  is wrong for the same reason. Just as we don\ufffdt consider federal defenses raised in the answer, we don\ufffdt consider counterclaims (that is, claims for relief asserted by the defendant against the plaintiff) in assessing arising-under jurisdiction. One irony here is that Garces could just as well have been the plaintiff in this dispute. Both parties had claims against the other. If Garces had filed suit first, his claim under the Federal Whistleblower Act would have supported federal arising-under jurisdiction. But he didn\ufffdt file first, and under  Mottley  the court will only consider Consolidated\ufffds claim in assessing its jurisdiction. Consequently, Garces will end up litigating his federal law defense and counterclaim in state court.  A  is the correct answer. When I test this issue, I always like to have one choice in which there\ufffds a vague federal presence that is not directly the source of the claims in the action. Here,  B  is wrong because the fact that the report was made to a federal agency doesn\ufffdt mean that Consolidated\ufffds claim arises under federal law. There\ufffds a vague federal flavor here, but if we ask what Consolidated is suing Garces for, the answer is, for libel, a claim arising under state law. Under  Mottley,  such peripheral involvement of federal law will not suffice to support jurisdiction. See, however, Section C below, which illustrates a situation in which a federal issue embedded in a state claim may support jurisdiction. E  is emphatically wrong, because an objection to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the case. If the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it must dismiss, even if the defendant wants the court to hear it, asserts her defenses and counterclaims, and proceeds to litigate there.  Mottley , in which the parties litigated to judgment in the trial court and appealed, illustrates the point. Although the parties wanted the Court to reach the merits, it dismissed because the federal trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case.",

            "Context": "What is a \ufffd\ufffdwell-pleaded complaint?\ufffd\ufffd \nRemember that  Mottley  is frequently referred to as the \ufffd\ufffdwell-pleaded complaint\ufffd\ufffd rule, because it requires the court to consider not what the plaintiff has pleaded, but what she  needed to plead  to state her cause of action. Just because the plaintiff makes allegations involving federal law in her complaint (as the Mottleys did to rebut the railroad\ufffds anticipated defense) doesn\ufffdt mean that her case arises under federal law. The court will ask what she would plead if she were just stating her own claim and not gilding the lily to get into federal court. This is puzzling for first year law students. You are just learning the elements of different legal claims, so it\ufffds hard to know what allegations are essential to a claim and which are not. But it\ufffds fairly clear on the facts of  Mottley  that the plaintiffs did not have to breathe a word about the federal statute in order to assert a valid complaint against the railroad. They certainly didn\ufffdt claim that they could get relief  because  of the federal statute, but rather in spite of it. The basic syllogism that supports their claim is \ufffd\ufffdWe made a contract with the railroad, it didn\ufffdt perform its obligations, we want an order to it to do so.\ufffd\ufffd That is the substance of the Mottleys\ufffd position, and it states a basic claim for breach of contract without any reference to a federal issue. Of course, the Mottleys  did  refer to federal law in their complaint: they alleged that the federal statute was the railroad\ufffds reason for refusing to perform the contract. But they didn\ufffdt  have to  allege that to state their contract claim, so the Supreme Court held that this superfluous allegation should be ignored in determining whether the case arises under federal law. The Court didn\ufffdt make this distinction just to wallow in technicalities. It did so to prevent manipulation by plaintiffs. If plaintiffs could \ufffd\ufffdmake a federal case\ufffd\ufffd out of a state law claim by including unnecessary references to federal law in their complaints, arising-under jurisdiction could be created by simply including peripheral or even irrelevant references to federal issues in the complaint. By asking not what is in the complaint, but what has to be, the court can limit the opportunity to manipulate the federal courts\ufffd jurisdiction.

Olefsky sues Acme in federal court, claiming that the dumping created a nuisance (a state law tort) that led to his injuries.

C  suggests that there must be both diversity  and  a federal question in order to sue in federal court. Not so; a plaintiff may sue in federal court as long as her case satisfies  one category  of federal jurisdiction . . . it doesn\ufffdt have to fit into two, or ten! Thus, if this case arises under federal law, it can be brought in federal court, even though the parties are both from Florida. Conversely, if they were diverse, the case could be brought in federal court even if it arose under state law. Does Olefsky\ufffds case arise under federal law?  A  suggests that it does if Acme violated the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. However, even if Acme violated the Act, that doesn\ufffdt mean that Olefsky\ufffds case arises under it. His claim for damages does not arise from the failure to file EPA reports; it arises from dumping by Acme\ufffds driver in an unlined area. So what if they violated the federal reporting statute? How does that strengthen Olefsky\ufffds case? He\ufffds suing for nuisance, a state tort theory based on different acts by the defendant. It\ufffds irrelevant to Olefsky\ufffds case that they violated other federal pollution requirements. Suppose Acme had violated a federal accounting statute, and Olefsky found that out. Could he sue for his pollution claim and argue that it arises under federal law because they violated a federal law irrelevant to his claim? Certainly not. Olefsky may have alleged a federal violation in his complaint, but it doesn\ufffdt  have to be in there  to state his claim against Acme. His \ufffd\ufffdwell-pleaded complaint\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdone that contains the allegations that entitle him to sue Acme for damages, but  only  those allegations\ufffd would contain nuisance allegations, but nothing about the Federal Toxics Transportation Act. Indeed, Olefsky\ufffds right to recover would be exactly the same if there were no Federal Toxics Transportation Act. If that is true, the statute is obviously irrelevant to his claim, and throwing promiscuous references to it into the complaint will not make the case \ufffd\ufffdarise under\ufffd\ufffd federal law. Thus,  A  is wrong, and that means that  B  is too. If it\ufffds irrelevant that Acme violated the statute, it\ufffds also irrelevant that Olefsky alleged that they did.  D  takes the prize.

            "Context": "State law claims that require proof of federal law. Under  Mottley , the court must look to see whether the plaintiff asserts a right to relief under federal law. If she does, the case \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd federal law, so the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331. In American Well Works v. Layne , 241 U.S. 257, 260 (1916), Justice Holmes suggested a commonly cited test for arising-under jurisdiction, that a suit arises \ufffd\ufffdunder the law that creates the cause of action.\ufffd\ufffd The Mottleys\ufffd claim flunked the Holmes test, since state contract law created their right to sue for their passes. It would be nice if the Holmes test decided all cases, but the law in this area just isn\ufffdt that tidy. The Supreme Court has occasionally held that a case in which state law creates the plaintiff\ufffds cause of action still \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd federal law, where the plaintiff, in order to establish her state law claim, must prove a substantial issue of federal law. See, in particular,  Smith v. Kansas City Title and Trust Co. , 255 U.S. 180 (1920). In  Smith,  the plaintiffs sued to enjoin a corporation from investing in certain bonds, claiming that doing so would exceed the corporation\ufffds powers under state corporation law. The claim the plaintiffs asserted was a state law claim, but to establish that it was illegal for the corporation to invest in the bonds, they had to establish that the federal statute authorizing issuance of the bonds was invalid. Thus, they did not have to  plead  federal law to allege a valid cause of action, but they had to  prove  a proposition of federal law to establish their state law claim. The Supreme Court held that this claim arose under federal law, even though the case clearly would not satisfy the Holmes test. In  Grable & Sons Metal Products Inc. v. Darue Engineering and Manufacturing Co. , 545 U.S. 308 (2005), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle relied on in  Smith  to support arising-under jurisdiction. In Grable , the plaintiff brought an action to quiet title\ufffda state law property claim\ufffdto recover property sold by the Internal Revenue Service to Darue after the IRS took the property from Grable for non-payment of taxes. Although Grable sued under state law, it claimed that the tax taking was invalid because the IRS had not complied with the notice required by the federal internal revenue code. Thus, it would have to establish a proposition of federal law\ufffdthe type of notice required by the federal statute\ufffdin order to prove its state law quiet title action. The Supreme Court held that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331. However,  Grable  did not hold that arising-under jurisdiction would attach every time the plaintiff had to prove some federal issue to establish a state law claim. The federal issue must be \ufffd\ufffdsubstantial,\ufffd\ufffd 545 U.S. at 312, and the court would have to consider various other policies \ufffdsuch as avoiding interference with state court jurisdiction, the need for uniform interpretation of a federal issue and the risk of bringing too many claims into federal court. After  Grable , federal courts must make sensitive judgments about the importance of the embedded federal issue, and such issues will sometimes, but not always, support arising-under jurisdiction. If this standard appears murky, it is, but perhaps has to be to accommodate the various interests at stake in such cases.

All they need to prove is that they had a contract and that the railroad has failed to perform it. (So  C  is wrong.) There is no federal issue embedded in their claim. The federal statute will be raised as a defense by the railroad. After  Grable , as before, courts still  look only to the plaintiff\ufffds case  to determine whether the case arises under federal law. The plaintiffs\ufffd case here does not require any allegation or proof of a proposition of federal law. B  is also wrong, because even if the applicability of the new federal statute is a substantial question of federal law, it is not one that the Mottleys must establish to prove their claim\ufffdthe railroad must prove it to establish a defense.

A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \ufffd\ufffdarising under federal law\ufffd\ufffd in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\ufffds complaint, shouldn\ufffdt that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \ufffd2? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the  Mottley  rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\ufffds in Question 1 , which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the  Mottley test.

The facts here are essentially a clone of  Mottley.  The plaintiff sues under state contract law, and the defendant asserts a federal defense to the claim. This is clearly not an arising-under case under the  Mottley  interpretation of \ufffd1331, because the plaintiff\ufffds well-pleaded complaint asserts only a state law claim. So  A  and  B  are both wrong: In order to satisfy the arising-under statute, \ufffd1331, the plaintiff herself must assert a right to relief under federal law, and Eleanor\ufffds claim is based on state contract law. 1  And since, under Mottley,  the court will only look at the plaintiff\ufffds complaint, not at the answer, in determining whether it has jurisdiction under \ufffd1331,  D  is wrong as well. The defendant\ufffds federal defense in his answer will be disregarded in evaluating the court\ufffds jurisdiction, even if the answer is already before the court when it determines the jurisdiction question. So  C  is the right answer. The case is within the constitutional grant of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III: Franklin\ufffds federal law defense makes federal law an \ufffd\ufffdingredient\ufffd\ufffd of the case, even though that ingredient is injected by the defendant, not the plaintiff. But the case is not proper under \ufffd1331, because  Mottley \ufffds well-pleaded complaint rule (still the governing interpretation of \ufffd1332(a)) requires that the plaintiff rely on federal law to make her claim.",

In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here\ufffds another example to drive home the point.",
            "Question": "6. Limiting the limits.  Congressperson Smith introduces a bill to add a $75,000.01 amount-in-controversy requirement to 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Smith\ufffds bill would be constitutional, since Congress may expand or restrict the jurisdiction of the federal district courts as it sees fit. B.

Smith\ufffds bill would be constitutional, because Congress may grant less than the full Article III jurisdiction to the federal courts. D.  Smith\ufffds bill would be unconstitutional, since Article III, \ufffd2 authorizes the federal district courts to hear all cases arising under federal law.",
            "Analysis": "Smith\ufffds bill would impose an additional limit on the jurisdiction of the federal district courts in arising-under cases. Not only would the  Mottley  rule apply, but even cases that satisfy  Mottley  could not be heard if less than $75,000.01 was in controversy. Clearly, this would prevent the district courts from hearing cases that are within the constitutional grant of arising-under jurisdiction. If Isaacs sued Eagleton under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) but only sought $25,000 in damages, his case certainly involves a \ufffd\ufffdfederal ingredient,\ufffd\ufffd his claim under a federal statute. His case even satisfies the Mottley  rule, since he seeks relief under the federal statute. But Smith\ufffds bill, if enacted, would prevent him from bringing this federal law claim in federal court. Not a problem. Article III establishes the outer limits on federal court jurisdiction, but the cases make it clear that, within those limits, Congress decides which cases they want the federal district courts to hear. Congress could grant arising-under jurisdiction very broadly, by authorizing the federal district courts to hear any case that \ufffd\ufffdinvolves\ufffd\ufffd federal law. This would convey virtually all of the jurisdiction permissible under  Osborn \ufffds \ufffd\ufffdfederal ingredient\ufffd\ufffd test. Or it could grant arising-under jurisdiction very selectively. For example, Congress could authorize jurisdiction over cases arising under the federal tax laws, but no others. Or it could grant none of the arising-under jurisdiction, if it chose to do so. Under this principle,  D  is incorrect. It implies that the federal district courts automatically have all the arising-under jurisdiction in Article III, so that Congress could not limit it. That is not the accepted interpretation. Article III describes the outer limits of the federal judicial power, but within those limits Congress regulates the federal district courts\ufffd jurisdiction. It must authorize them to hear cases by statute. It can, and always has conveyed jurisdiction selectively. It isn\ufffdt enough that a case is within the outer bounds of Article III; it must also be authorized in a jurisdictional statute.  B  is off the mark for the same reason; there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress\ufffds limiting the arising-under jurisdiction of the federal district courts. Perhaps the most plausible \ufffd\ufffddistractor\ufffd\ufffd is  A , which takes the position that the bill is constitutional because Congress may \ufffd\ufffdexpand or restrict the jurisdiction of the federal district courts as it sees fit.\ufffd\ufffd This isn\ufffdt quite true. It may  restrict  their jurisdiction as it sees fit, but it may not  expand  their jurisdiction as it sees fit. Article III sets the outer limit. If Congress passed a statute authorizing federal district court jurisdiction over divorces, that statute would be unconstitutional, because nothing in Article III (leaving diversity aside, anyway) authorizes federal courts to hear divorce cases. That leaves  C , which is the right answer. If Congress wants to limit the district courts to \ufffd\ufffdbig\ufffd\ufffd federal question cases through an amount-in- controversy requirement, it may do so. While this would indeed \ufffd\ufffdrestrict the right of plaintiffs to take some cases arising under federal law to federal court\ufffd\ufffd ( B ), Congress may do that. It always has in diversity cases, and at one time, did in arising-under cases as well. See Pub. L.

            "Context": "Our analysis of arising-under jurisdiction demonstrates that a great many cases that raise federal issues cannot be brought in federal court. Cases like  Mottley,  in which federal law is raised as a defense, or cases in which a federal law counterclaim is asserted, are not within federal court arising-under jurisdiction. So what becomes of them? They are brought in state court, of course. State courts are competent to decide issues of federal law, and in cases like these they must do so. Suppose, however, that the plaintiff has a case that is within federal arising-under jurisdiction, even as narrowly construed under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331, but wants to bring it in state court. Can she do that? Put another way,  must  a case be brought in federal court if it satisfies the  Mottley standard for arising-under jurisdiction? Generally, the answer is \ufffd\ufffdno.\ufffd\ufffd Most cases that arise under federal law may be brought in state court if the plaintiff prefers to do so. For example, if Isaacs has a claim under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, it clearly arises under federal law and may be filed in federal court. But Isaacs would have the right to sue in state court instead, if she prefers. If she sues under 42 U.S.C. \ufffd1983, for violation of her federal civil rights, she could certainly do so in federal court under Mottley,  but again, she doesn\ufffdt have to. The jurisdiction of the federal and state courts over most types of federal law cases is said to be \ufffd\ufffdconcurrent,\ufffd\ufffd that is, the courts of both systems can entertain these cases. Like so many legal principles, this one has an exception. It has long been held that Congress may, if it chooses, provide by statute that the federal courts\ufffd jurisdiction over a particular type of federal claim is exclusive, that is, that those federal claims  must  be brought in federal court. See, e.g.,  Bowles v. Willingham,  321 U.S. 503, 511-512 (1944). Congress has mandated suit in federal court in some categories of cases. For example, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1338(a) provides in part that \ufffd\ufffd[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Occasionally, too, the Supreme Court has concluded that Congress intended federal court jurisdiction to be exclusive, even though the statute isn\ufffdt clear on the point. But this is quite rare. In most cases, jurisdiction is concurrent with the courts of the states, unless the federal statute conferring jurisdiction confines jurisdiction to the federal courts. See generally C. Wright & M.K. Kane, The Law of Federal Courts  \ufffd45 (8th ed. 2017). With this background, the following problem should be pretty easy.",

            "Analysis": "D  is a truly distracting distractor. It suggests that a federal question case must be brought in federal court if the parties are diverse. That isn\ufffdt so. The plaintiff here has sued under a federal statute, so the case is an arising-under case. As discussed above, state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over most arising-under cases. The state citizenship of the parties is utterly irrelevant to an arising-under case. The plaintiff may bring it in state court if she likes, whether she is diverse from the defendant or not. Or she could bring it in federal court, again, whether she is diverse from the defendant or not. The state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over diversity cases too, by the way. A plaintiff is free to file a case against a citizen of another state in state court if she prefers (unless, of course, she sues the diverse defendant on one of those rare federal claims for which Congress has made federal court jurisdiction exclusive). Indeed, one of the main reasons for removal jurisdiction is to address the situation where a local plaintiff has sued an out-of-state defendant in state court. B  is wrong because it suggests that a plaintiff who sues under federal law must use federal court. That isn\ufffdt so; federal claims may be brought in state court unless Congress has provided that they must be filed in federal court. And  C  is wrong because it reverses the general presumption. It is based on the premise that Congress must expressly authorize suit on a particular type of federal claim in state court in order for the state court to have jurisdiction. The presumption is the opposite: the state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction unless Congress restricts a particular type of federal claim to the federal courts. Only if the Lanburn Act provides for exclusive federal court jurisdiction must the case be brought in federal court.  A  takes the cake.",

            "Question": "8. Polymolysorbate.  Antril, a Florida citizen, sues Manello, from Kentucky, in federal court.

She also asserts a claim, in the same action, against Acme, a Florida corporation, for violation of the Federal Toxics Transportation Act (FTTA). That statute bars transporting polymolysorbate in a truck that lacks a secondary containment system, and allows recovery for resulting pollution damages. Antril\ufffds damages are, quite probably, several hundred thousand dollars. Manello answers the complaint denying that he drove negligently. In its answer, Acme admits that the Federal Toxics Transportation Act requires secondary containment for polymolysorbate, but denies that the polymolysorbate spilled from its truck. It alleges that its truck was not carrying polymolysorbate, so it must have come from an earlier spill by a different hauler.",

D.  The federal district court lacks jurisdiction over the suit, since Antril and Acme are both citizens of Florida and thus, under  Strawbridge,  there is no complete diversity.",
            "Analysis": "In this case, Antril has brought a claim arising under a federal statute against one of the defendants, Acme, but Acme claims that it did not violate the statute upon which Antril bases her claim. First, let\ufffds deal with  D . It is true that there is not complete diversity among the parties, since Antril and Acme are both from Florida. But diversity is irrelevant to Antril\ufffds claim against Acme. Antril sued Acme on a claim arising under federal law, so the citizenship of these parties is irrelevant. Leaving aside supplemental jurisdiction (as I asked you to do), Antril\ufffds claim against Manello is a state law negligence claim, so it may only be brought in federal court based on diversity. But Antril and Manello are diverse and we can ignore the citizenship of Acme, since Antril sued it on a different jurisdictional basis, a federal question claim. Just to make this point clear, imagine that Antril had sued Manello and Acme in two separate actions. If so, the federal court would have jurisdiction over the case against Manello based on diversity, and jurisdiction over the case against Acme based on arising-under jurisdiction. If she can do this (and she could) there is no reason why she can\ufffdt sue them together, and base jurisdiction over the two claims on two separate grounds. Since the only parties to the claim based on diversity are Antril and Manello, diversity jurisdiction is proper over that claim. The fact that Acme is from Florida is irrelevant, since the claim against it is based on arising-under jurisdiction. Its citizenship thus does not defeat diversity jurisdiction over Antril\ufffds claim against Manello. B  is clearly a loser. Imagine if the federal court\ufffds jurisdiction turned on whether or not the plaintiff\ufffds allegations turned out to be true: the court would not be able to determine its jurisdiction until the factual issues were tried. Generally, courts must know whether they have the power to hear a case from the outset, not based on events down the road (so to speak). So the court will not base its jurisdiction on whether Acme has actually violated the FTTA, but whether Antril asserts a colorable claim that it did. C  argues that the claim does not arise under federal law, because no issue of federal law is actually disputed between Antril and Acme. Acme doesn\ufffdt deny that the Act requires special precautions for transporting polymolysorbate, or that it would be liable if it violated the Act. Instead, it simply denies that it violated the federal statute. It doesn\ufffdt deny that the statute would be violated if they did what Antril alleges, it simply argues, \ufffd\ufffdwe didn\ufffdt do it.\ufffd\ufffd So the parties will not have to litigate the meaning or the applicability of the FTTA, they will only litigate a factual was it Acme that spilled polymolysorbate on Antril\ufffds land? Although this is true, the claim still \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd the federal act. Under  Mottley,  arising-under jurisdiction exists if the plaintiff seeks relief under the federal statute. Certainly she does: she claims damages under the FTTA, a federal statute. Although the parties don\ufffdt contest the meaning or applicability of the federal statute, Antril does seek relief under it. That is all that  Mottley  requires. And it makes sense that parties seeking relief under federal law should have access to federal court, even if the dispute involves a factual application of federal law rather than a legal interpretation. Federal courts play an important role by applying undisputed federal standards evenhandedly, as well as by construing the meaning of those standards. Federal policies can be just as surely undermined by unsympathetic application to facts as by hostile interpretation. A , after all, is right. The federal district court has jurisdiction over the entire case. It has jurisdiction over Antril\ufffds claim against Manello based on diversity, and her claim against Acme because it seeks relief under federal law. 2",

            "Context": "Mongrel jurisdiction: Supplemental claims. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several\ufffdperhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can\ufffdt do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn\ufffdt arise under federal law, and there\ufffds no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn\ufffdt brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein\ufffds contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same \ufffd\ufffdnucleus of operative facts\ufffd\ufffd but could not be brought in federal court alone.  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,  383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such \ufffd\ufffdsupplemental\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same \ufffd\ufffdcase or controversy.\ufffd\ufffd Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the \ufffd\ufffdcommon nucleus of operative facts\ufffd\ufffd test of  Gibbs.  So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to  Chapter 14 ) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn\ufffdt otherwise be brought in federal court. Here\ufffds a basic illustration.",
            "Question": "9. Tagging along.  Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He sues in federal court. Isaacs claims that United fired him because of his age, replacing him with a younger employee. Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent.

            "Analysis": "B  takes the position that the federal court cannot hear cases between citizens of the same state. But they can, so long as the plaintiff relies on some basis of federal jurisdiction other than diversity. If Smith sues Doe, another Nevadan, for a federal civil rights violation under 42 U.S.C. \ufffd1983, he may of course do so in federal court, even though both parties are from the same state. C  is also wrong, because, even though there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over Isaacs\ufffds state law claims, there will be supplemental jurisdiction over at least one. The supplemental jurisdiction statute authorizes federal courts that have jurisdiction over a case, because a proper federal claim is asserted, to hear the entire \ufffd\ufffdcase,\ufffd\ufffd that is, the parties\ufffd entire dispute arising out of the same underlying facts. That includes claims arising from those events that don\ufffdt independently qualify for federal court jurisdiction. Here, Isaacs\ufffds breach of contract claim arises from his discharge, as his federal ADEA claim does. Since the ADEA claim arises under federal law, it provides a basis for federal court jurisdiction, and supplemental jurisdiction sweeps in other claims arising from the same facts. See 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a) (allowing supplemental claims that arise out of the \ufffd\ufffdsame case or controversy\ufffd\ufffd as the federally sufficient claim). The closer choice here is between  A  and  D . The crucial question is whether the misappropriation claim arises from the same \ufffd\ufffdnucleus of operative facts\ufffd\ufffd as the discharge claims. I would think not. This claim arises from United\ufffds use of his design. He would have this claim whether he had been discharged or not, and the claim accrued well before the discharge. The answer might be different, or at least closer, if the question suggested that Isaacs was fired for making a claim to the design, but it doesn\ufffdt. So  D  is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under \ufffd1367 (or under  U.M.W. v. Gibbs ) for supplemental jurisdiction.",

Ivanov answers the complaint denying liability, and the parties proceed to engage in discovery. Ten months later, Taney becomes disenchanted with the federal judge assigned to hear the case.

            "Analysis": "C  seems like a pretty reasonable answer here. Why should Taney, who invoked the federal court\ufffds jurisdiction, be allowed to challenge it when the case looks as though it may be going sour? Isn\ufffdt he manipulating the system, and shouldn\ufffdt he be estopped from denying jurisdiction, in order to discourage such manipulation? There\ufffds a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don\ufffdt exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid. To avoid such wasteful and unconstitutional exercises, the trial court will always consider challenges to its jurisdiction. \ufffd\ufffdIf the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). This reasoning disposes of  D  as well. The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived\ufffdat least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley,  for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance. 3  So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier. A  suggests that the court can retain the case if it \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd federal law as that phrase is used in Article III, \ufffd2, even if \ufffd1331 doesn\ufffdt authorize federal jurisdiction over it. I suppose the logic here is that, as long as it would not offend  constitutional  limits for the federal court to hear the case, it has the power to do so, even if the case does not satisfy Congress\ufffds  statutory  limits on arising-under jurisdiction. However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. So  B , then, is the best answer. To avoid exceeding the limits on its jurisdictional competence, the federal court will dismiss if it determines that it lacks jurisdiction, despite Taney\ufffds failure to raise the objection earlier.",

            "Context": "Arising under jurisdiction in the Supreme Court The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn\ufffdt remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in  Mottley.  And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in  Mottley  bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn\ufffdt? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn,  the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is \ufffd\ufffdan ingredient\ufffd\ufffd in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the  Mottley  rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331, to which the  Mottley  rule applies,  does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court.  It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court\ufffds appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1257, is a great deal broader than \ufffd1331. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised\ufffdby defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

But the state court\ufffds decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under \ufffd1257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is \ufffd\ufffdrepugnant to the Constitution.\ufffd\ufffd Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.",

            "Analysis": "E  is wrong; the Mottleys\ufffd names really were Erasmus and Annie. More importantly,  A  is wrong. Profoundly wrong. It is based on the assumption that the  Mottley  rule applies to the Supreme Court\ufffds jurisdiction. It doesn\ufffdt. As iterated and reiterated,  Mottley  interprets 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331, which conveys part of the constitutionally permissible arising-under jurisdiction to the federal trial courts, the federal district courts. It does not control the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. For cases coming up for review from the state courts, \ufffd1257 does. B  is flawed as well. Section \ufffd1257 authorizes Supreme Court review of the state court\ufffds holding that the federal statute violates the Constitution (\ufffd\ufffdwhere the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question\ufffd\ufffd). And it authorizes review of the state court\ufffds interpretation of the statute. The railroad, in its defense, had claimed an \ufffd\ufffdimmunity\ufffd\ufffd from its obligation to renew the passes under a federal statute (\ufffd\ufffdany title, right, privilege, or immunity . . . specially set up or claimed under the . . . statutes of . . . the United States\ufffd\ufffd). Section 1257 broadly authorizes review where federal issues are decided by state courts, even though they are not the basis of the plaintiff\ufffds original complaint. It is most important to understand why  C  is wrong. It recognizes that Congress has broadly authorized the Supreme Court to review federal issues decided by state courts, but suggests that this authority is unconstitutional because it violates the  Mottley  well-pleaded complaint rule. But (sorry to repeat myself)  Mottley  does not interpret the Constitution, it is an interpretation of \ufffd1331, governing the jurisdiction of the federal district courts.  Osborn  held that the  constitutional  grant of arising-under jurisdiction includes any case in which federal law forms an \ufffd\ufffdingredient\ufffd\ufffd of the case. So the appeal in this example clearly is a proper arising-under case under the Constitution. The Supreme Court has the authority, under \ufffd1257 and under the  Osborn \ufffds reading of Article III, to review both rulings.  D  is the right answer. And \ufffd1257 expressly authorizes review of both federal issues, even though they were not asserted by the Mottleys in their well-pleaded complaint. All of this explains how the Mottleys ultimately got their case heard in the U.S. Supreme Court. After their federal suit was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, they sued in state court. They won, and the railroad, invoking an earlier version of \ufffd1257, appealed to the Supreme Court. Under that statute, the Court had the authority to review the substantive federal issues raised in the state court suit.

            "Context": "The basic standard for removal jurisdiction The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court\ufffds jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing  a case to federal court should mirror the standard for  filing  one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1441(a) provides that \ufffd\ufffdany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, \ufffd2? If not, it can\ufffdt be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here\ufffds a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.",

Castor Chemical Company, a California company, sues Pollux, from California, in state court for breach of contract, claiming that Pollux agreed to manufacture a drug for Castor and then reneged. Pollux answers the complaint, admitting that he refused to deliver the drug, and offering as an affirmative defense that he learned, after making the contract, that the drug was covered by a patent, so that, under federal patent law, he could not manufacture it without a license to do so. After answering, Pollux removes the action to federal court.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The action is properly removed, because at the time he removed, Pollux had raised a federal law issue in his answer. B.  The action is properly removed, because the case \ufffd\ufffdarises under\ufffd\ufffd federal law within the meaning of that phrase in Article III, \ufffd2. C.  The action is not properly removed, because it is a federal question case, not a diversity case. D.  The action is not properly removed, because the case does not \ufffd\ufffdarise under\ufffd\ufffd federal law within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331.",
            "Analysis": "The third choice,  C , is particularly illogical. Under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1441(a), cases may be removed to federal court if they are within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts. Cases arising under federal law are within the federal courts\ufffd jurisdiction, so they, like diversity cases, may be removed under \ufffd1441(a). The other three options are closer.  A  appears to rest on the premise that a case may be removed whenever it is clear that a federal issue will be litigated in the action. But that isn\ufffdt the standard under \ufffd1441(a); under that section, the case can only be removed if it could have been filed originally in federal court. As we belabored in the previous chapter, many cases that  involve  federal law cannot be filed in federal court. Witness poor Erasmus and Annie Mottley\ufffds case. The test for removal is whether the plaintiff could have filed the case initially in federal court, not whether some federal issue is likely to arise or has arisen in the action. This case could not have been filed in federal court, for the same reason that the Mottleys\ufffd action was thrown out by the Supreme Court: it arises under state contract law. There\ufffds a difference between this example and  Mottley,  however. Here, at the time of removal, the defendant had  actually asserted  the federal defense in his answer. Thus, the federal issue is already in the case; there is no need to speculate as to whether a federal issue will be litigated in the action. However, this does not change the result. The removal statute provides that only cases that could have been filed originally in federal court may be removed. Castor could not have filed this action in federal court, because it arises under state law and the parties are not diverse. So, the terms of the removal statute itself bar removal here.  A  is wrong. This point is the key to  B  as well. It is true that this case arises under federal law within the meaning of Article III, \ufffd2, as expounded by Chief Justice Marshall in  Osborn.  Pollux has injected a \ufffd\ufffdfederal ingredient\ufffd\ufffd into the case by raising a federal defense. But under \ufffd1441(a) the case may only be removed if it could have filed in federal court. And we know that to file a case in federal court, it must not only fall within the scope of the Article III grant, but must also be conveyed to the federal district court by statute. Castor\ufffds case is within the Article III grant, but it is not within the statutory grant of arising-under jurisdiction in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331. Under  Mottley,  the plaintiff\ufffds complaint must rely on federal law as the source of his right to relief, to \ufffd\ufffdarise under\ufffd\ufffd federal law within the meaning of \ufffd1331. The court will not look at the defendant\ufffds answer in determining whether the claim arises under federal law. So the case could not have been brought in federal court initially, and therefore cannot be removed.  D  is the winner.",

            "Context": "A logical limit on removal of diversity cases While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: \ufffd1441(b)(2).  A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in  favor  of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration.",

Swensson answers the complaint, denying that he battered Ortiz, and asserts in the answer a counterclaim demanding damages under 42 U.S.C. \ufffd1983, for violation of his federal civil rights in the course of the arrest.

The federal court lacks jurisdiction over the case, under \ufffd1441(b)(2). C.  The federal district court has jurisdiction over the case, based on the federal counterclaim. D.  The federal district court has jurisdiction, because Swensson is an out-of-state defendant.",
            "Analysis": "A  is tempting, because we know that, usually, if the plaintiff could have filed a case in federal court to begin with, the defendant can remove it. And it is true that this case could have been filed in federal court: It\ufffds a case between a Georgian, a North Carolinian and a Virginian, so there\ufffds complete diversity, and the amount in controversy is over $75,000. But we also know that \ufffd1441(b)(2) is an exception to the general rule that a case that could have been filed in federal court initially can be removed. That section provides that a diversity case\ufffdeven one that could have been filed in federal court\ufffdcan\ufffdt be removed if there\ufffds an in- state defendant. So  A  is not an accurate statement in this context. D  is also tempting. Swensson, the removing defendant here, is from out of state, so he may fear prejudice in the Virginia court. In fact, he may fear that the court or the jury will favor Dracut, the in-state defendant, over him. Swensson might legitimately prefer to reduce that risk by removing. Unfortunately, under \ufffd1441(b)(2), he cannot. A diversity case can\ufffdt be removed if there is an in-state defendant . . . even if there\ufffds  also  an out-of-state defendant. C  is also a loser. It suggests that, if the plaintiff files a nonremovable case in state court, the defendant can make it removable by filing a counterclaim under federal law. This is not generally true. Removal must be based on the plaintiff\ufffds case, not on the defendant\ufffds defenses or counterclaims. This follows from \ufffd1441(a), which makes removal turn (except for the in-state defendant exception just discussed) on whether the case could have been filed initially in federal court.

            "Context": "Removal later in the litigation. The removal statute sets a strict limit on the time for removing a case to federal court. Under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days \ufffd\ufffdafter receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. . . .\ufffd\ufffd There\ufffds a reason for this short window to remove a case. The state court needs to know whether it is going to hear the case or not. Under \ufffd1446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won\ufffdt be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but  becomes removable  later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can\ufffdt be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn\ufffdt removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in \ufffd1446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under \ufffd1446(b)(3), this ploy won\ufffdt work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court. Here\ufffds an interesting question on the application of \ufffd1446(b)(3).",
            "Question": "3. Professor\ufffds delight.  Diversified Investments, Inc., an investment corporation, sues Eagleton for breach of contract, to collect $300,000 due on a margin account she had with Diversified. Diversified is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Colorado. It has a large office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Diversified brings the action in Colorado. Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account. Four months later, Diversified moves to amend its complaint to add a claim against Eagleton under a federal fraud statute, based on misrepresentations Eagleton allegedly made in establishing her margin account. The motion is granted. Two weeks later, Eagleton removes the action to federal court. Diversified moves to remand the case to state court. The motion to remand should be",
            "Options": "Options: A.  granted, because the federal court lacks jurisdiction, since both parties are citizens of Utah. B.  granted, because Eagleton did not remove the action within thirty days after the action was filed. C.  denied, because Eagleton had the right, under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1446(b)(2), to remove within thirty days after the amendment was granted. D.  denied, because Eagleton had the right, under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1446(b)(2), to remove within thirty days after receiving notice that the amendment had been granted.",
            "Analysis": "Here, the plaintiff filed suit in state court. The parties started to litigate in state court, and then the plaintiff added a federal claim. After the amendment, Eagleton removes the case, based on the newly added claim arising under federal law. However, \ufffd1446(b)(3), read carefully, bars removal. It authorizes removal later in the case if it was not removable as originally filed, but  becomes removable  due to an amendment or for other reasons. That isn\ufffdt this case: Eagleton\ufffds case was a proper diversity case and was therefore removable when filed. She chose not to remove within thirty days of receiving notice of the original complaint. Now she wants a second bite at the apple, since Diversified has asserted a federal claimand she would rather litigate the federal claim in federal court. Unfortunately for Eagleton, \ufffd1446(b)(3) doesn\ufffdt authorize removal. Both  C  and  D  are wrong, because, if the case was removable originally, and the defendant failed to remove it within thirty days, she has lost the option of federal court. Doubtless, Congress could authorize removal in these circumstances. It could rewrite \ufffd 1446(b)(3) to allow a second shot when a new basis of federal jurisdiction is asserted. This might even make good policy: a defendant might be perfectly willing to litigate a contract case in the state court, but prefer federal court to litigate the federal claim that is added later. However, the language of \ufffd1446(b) just doesn\ufffdt reach her case. A  should not have thrown you off. First of all, Diversified is not a citizen of Utah just because it has an office there. For diversity purposes, a corporation is a citizen of the state of its principal place of business and state of incorporation. Neither of these is in Utah. So Diversified is diverse from Eagleton. Second, once Diversified adds the claim under federal law, the federal court would have jurisdiction over the case even if the parties are from the same state. So the federal court would have jurisdiction over the case, as amended, if removal was proper. However, under \ufffd1446(b)(3), it is not, since the case did not \ufffd\ufffdbecome removable\ufffd\ufffd by the addition of the federal claim. It already was removable. So, the answer is  B . The action should be remanded because it was not removed within thirty days of the original filing. This question is a \ufffd\ufffdprofessor\ufffds delight,\ufffd\ufffd because, while it is fair, it is tricky. The question focuses the student on the amendment adding the federal claim, and invites her to overlook the crucial fact that Eagleton could have removed earlier and did not. Remember the comment that the multistate bar exam (which is all multiple choice) is \ufffd\ufffdan exercise in reading comprehension.\ufffd\ufffd Here\ufffds a good example of that. You might know the law, or be capable of solving this problem by careful reading of \ufffd1446(b)(3) (remember, I\ufffdm assuming that you have the statutes in front of you in answering these questions), but miss the point by a mile if you don\ufffdt analyze the question carefully. Probably students get more questions wrong from such analytical slips than they do from a lack of substantive knowledge.",

            "Context": "Making something out of nothing: Removal of exclusive federal jurisdiction cases It used to be said that a federal court\ufffds jurisdiction in a removed case was \ufffd\ufffdderivative,\ufffd\ufffd that is, that it acquired its jurisdiction based on a properly filed state law case. A logical corollary of this conceptual thinking was that, if the state court did not have jurisdiction over a case, it could not be removed to federal court. Suppose, for example, that Wyzanski files suit against Koukios for patent infringement in a state court, and that Koukios removes it to federal court. Wyzanski\ufffds case arises under federal law, so it is within the federal court\ufffds jurisdiction. The twist here, however, is that Congress has provided in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1338(a) that federal jurisdiction in patent cases is exclusive of the courts of the states. Thus, the state court in which the case was filed had no jurisdiction to entertain Wyzanski\ufffds claim in the first place. Under the \ufffd\ufffdderivative jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd reasoning of an earlier day, Koukios could not remove Wyzanski\ufffds suit to federal court. The federal court\ufffds jurisdiction was thought to \ufffd\ufffdderive from\ufffd\ufffd that of the state court. If the state court lacked jurisdiction, the federal court could not acquire jurisdiction on removal. You couldn\ufffdt, under this theory, make something out of nothing. So the court had to dismiss the claim. It couldn\ufffdt even remand it to state court, since that court had no jurisdiction. The result was that, because the case had to be in federal court, the federal court would dismiss it! There was a certain formal logic to this rule, but not a lot of common sense. After the federal court dismissed the action, the plaintiff would have to refile . . . in the federal court. So Congress wisely enacted 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1441(f): \ufffd\ufffdThe court to which such civil action is removed under this section is not precluded from hearing and determining any claim in such civil action because the State court from which such civil action is removed did not have jurisdiction over that claim.\ufffd\ufffd Under \ufffd1441(f), the federal court acquires jurisdiction over a removed case, even if the state court from which it was removed had none.

            "Context": "The effect of removal on objections to personal jurisdiction. Students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction. Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn\ufffdt sure that her objection will carry the day; it\ufffds a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she\ufffds going to remove, she\ufffds got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and  then remove to federal court  within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal  does not waive  the defendant\ufffds right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the  federal  court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). I\ufffdve stumped a multitude of students on this point. Consider the following two cases to clarify the point.",

The fact that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over this diversity case does  not  mean that it has personal jurisdiction over Boyle. Though easily confused, the subject matter and personal jurisdiction analyses are separate; the court must have both subject matter jurisdiction over the case and personal jurisdiction over the defendant in order to proceed with the case. A  reflects the faulty assumption that removal waives objections to personal jurisdiction. It doesn\ufffdt; it simply changes the forum in which the personal jurisdiction question will be litigated. Boyle may remove the case, and then respond to it, raising his defenses and jurisdictional objections in federal court. And  B  is wrong, because Boyle removed the case before the answer was due in state court. It is true, under some states\ufffd procedural rules, that answering a complaint without including an objection to personal jurisdiction would waive it. But where a defendant removes before a response is due in state court, she does not waive any defenses by removal. She simply changes the forum in which such defenses will be raised. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1) (Federal Rules govern procedure after removal). C  is also wrong, because it suggests that, after removal, personal jurisdiction over Boyle will be tested by a different standard from that used in state court. In a diversity case, the reach of the federal court\ufffds personal jurisdiction is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A), which provides that the defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction in the federal court if she \ufffd\ufffdis subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.\ufffd\ufffd In other words, if the state courts of Oregon could exercise jurisdiction over Boyle, the Oregon federal court can; otherwise not.

If Akila sues Redstone and Cianci in state court on a federal claim, and Redstone wants to be in federal court, but Cianci doesn\ufffdt, the case cannot be removed. Well, that\ufffds not quite true. Redstone could file a notice of removal, but if Cianci wants the state forum, he would then move to remand to the state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal.

If a case is removable, it must be removed within thirty days. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1446(a). But there\ufffds another thirty-day rule in the removal statutes, and it\ufffds trickier than the first.

The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the  first  thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of \ufffd1447(c)\ufffds waiver provision.",

See \ufffd1447(c) (objections \ufffd\ufffdother than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd must be made within thirty days after filing of the notice of removal). But the amount-in-controversy requirement is met here. Tyrgyz claims that either Boch or Ivens caused his injury, he doesn\ufffdt know which. So there is a legitimate claim for that amount against each. See  Chapter 2 , pp.  21-22.  If the jury concludes that Boch caused the harm, he could be held liable for $120,000. If it concludes that Ivens caused it, she will. If it concludes that neither is liable, Tyrgyz will lose. But he still has asserted a colorable claim for $120,000 against each defendant, and might recover that amount from either. So  A  is wrong. B  is also quite credible. Ivens didn\ufffdt join in the notice of removal, and under \ufffd1446(b)(2)(a) the case can\ufffdt be heard in federal court if Ivens doesn\ufffdt agree to the removal. The problem is that no one moved to remand the case within the thirty-day window for motions to remand based on objections other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Ivens\ufffds failure to join is a defect, but not a  jurisdictional  defect. The case is a proper diversity case, whether Ivens joins in the notice of removal or not. So Ivens has waived her objection to removal if she doesn\ufffdt move to remand within thirty days. That\ufffds the effect of \ufffd1447(c)\ufffds requirement that a motion to remand based on any problem with the removal\ufffdother than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\ufffdbe made within thirty days. If no motion is made, the objection is waived. So  C  takes the prize.

            "Context": "The jurisdictional premise of  Pennoyer v. Neff The early law of personal jurisdiction, represented by  Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877), based personal jurisdiction on physical power over the defendant, at least in cases against individuals. The logic was that a court had the authority to exert physical power over a defendant within the territory of the state where the court sat. The court could order a sheriff to seize and detain the defendant if he found her within the state. So, the logic proceeded, if the sheriff asserted that authority symbolically, by serving the defendant with process in the state, rather than actually arresting her, the court would acquire jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and could enter a judgment against her if she were found liable. Here\ufffds a quick example to illustrate  Pennoyer \ufffds \ufffd\ufffdpresence theory\ufffd\ufffd of personal jurisdiction.",
            "Question": "1. Gone, but not forgotten.  Neff hired Mitchell, a lawyer, in Oregon to sue Jones for breach of contract. Neff agreed to pay Mitchell $300 for his services. Mitchell did the work, but Neff left the state for California and didn\ufffdt pay Mitchell\ufffds fee. Mitchell sues Neff for his fee in an Oregon state court, and has Neff served with process in Oregon while Neff was visiting there on unrelated business. Neff promptly departed once more for California and has not returned to the state since. Under personal jurisdiction theory as expounded in  Pennoyer,  the Oregon court",
            "Options": "Options: A.  has personal jurisdiction over Neff. B.  does not have personal jurisdiction over Neff, because he was served while he was there for a purpose unrelated to the fees claim. C.  does not have jurisdiction over Neff, because he is no longer physically present in Oregon. D.  has jurisdiction over Neff for the fees claim, but would not have jurisdiction over him if Mitchell had sued him for a claim that arose in another state.",
            "Analysis": "This question makes the basic point about  Pennoyer : that jurisdiction was acquired by the symbolic act of in-state service of process, and that once in-state service was made, the court acquired the power to adjudicate the case for which process was served. The distractors reflect various misconceptions about this principle. C  suggests that, for the court to litigate the case, the defendant must not only have been served with process in the state, but remain in the state while the case proceeded. Not so. The logic of  Pennoyer  was that a defendant within the state was subject to the sheriff\ufffds (and the court\ufffds) power to arrest. Under early English practice, the local sheriff may actually have arrested the defendant and held her pending resolution of the case, or at least had the power to do so. Later, actual arrest of the defendant gave way to symbolic seizure, through personal delivery of the court papers in the suit. However, the premise was that this symbolic seizure subjected the defendant to the court\ufffds authority, not just at the moment of service, but on an ongoing basis. The court\ufffds power, once properly asserted by service of process within the forum state, continued throughout the litigation. Neff could leave after he was served if he wanted, but that would not prevent the court from proceeding with the case once it had acquired jurisdiction. B  fails as well. It suggests that Neff could only be subjected to jurisdiction through in-state service if he was in the state for some reason connected to the plaintiff\ufffds claim. But the logic of  Pennoyer  was that a defendant present within the forum state was subject to the authority of that state\ufffds courts, without regard to  why  he was there. Jurisdiction was based on symbolic arrest, not on any relationship between Neff\ufffds reason for being in Oregon and the law suit. He could be there to play the lottery, to visit the zoo, or to be inaugurated as governor; it wouldn\ufffdt matter. His presence when served was the key, not the reason for that presence. D  also comes up short. It suggests that jurisdiction could be based on service of process in the state, but that the court would only acquire jurisdiction by in-state service to adjudicate claims that arose within the state. This is another misconception. If Mitchell filed suit in Oregon, and served Neff with the papers for that suit in Oregon, it didn\ufffdt matter what the claim was for. It could be for an auto accident in Maine, a property dispute in Texas, or lies told about him in Minnesota. Jurisdiction was not based on any relation between the claim and the state; it was based on the premise that the court could exert judicial power over a person physically present there. (After all, if Neff never came back to Oregon, Mitchell would have to sue him in California under  Pennoyer \ufffds approach, and the California court would then exercise jurisdiction over Neff, even though the claim Mitchell sued upon arose in Oregon.) So  A  is the winner. If Mitchell managed to serve Neff with the papers initiating the suit in Oregon, under  Pennoyer  the Oregon court obtained jurisdiction over Neff for that suit, and leaving wouldn\ufffdt deprive the court of authority to proceed. Once jurisdiction attached, it continued, even though the sheriff, after \ufffd\ufffdcatching\ufffd\ufffd Neff in the state, let him go.",

            "Context": "In-state contacts as an alternative basis for exercising jurisdiction. To some extent, the logic of  Pennoyer  persists. In  Burnham v. Superior Court,  495 U.S. 604 (1990), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that an individual defendant who is served with process in the state will usually be subject to personal jurisdiction in the action for which service was made. But the  Pennoyer  framework for jurisdiction never worked very well for corporations. Ultimately, the Supreme Court, in  International Shoe v. Washington,  326 U.S. 310 (1945), held that another basis, \ufffd\ufffdminimum contacts . . . such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \ufffdtraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd (326 U.S. at 316), would also support personal jurisdiction over a defendant. Subsequent cases have made clear that such \ufffd\ufffdminimum contacts\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction applies to individual defendants as well as corporations. The rationale underlying minimum contacts jurisdiction is different from that underlying  Pennoyer. International Shoe  recognized that the \ufffd\ufffddue process\ufffd\ufffd required by the Constitution could be based not only on the formalistic concept of physical arrest, but also on the idea that a defendant, by choosing to engage in activities in a state, submitted to litigation there if claims arose out of those voluntary activities in the state. The idea is that it is fair to make the defendant take the bitter with the sweet. If she chooses to engage in activities focused on a state, that state may require her to answer there for claims that arise from those activities she chooses to conduct in the state. She may not be sued there for  any  claim based on limited in-state activities, however, only for claims arising out of the in-state activities. Here\ufffds a question that highlights the shift in the jurisdictional rationale from  Pennoyer  to  Shoe.",
            "Question": "2. Contact sports.  Neff went to Oregon and met with Mitchell, a lawyer, about a claim Neff had against Jones. Mitchell did some work on the problem and sent Neff, a Californian, a bill for $3,000. After consulting Mitchell, Neff left Oregon, has not been back since, and has never paid Mitchell\ufffds bill. Mitchell sues Neff in an Oregon state court for his fee. He has the papers initiating the suit served on Neff in California.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Jurisdiction based on in-state service was reaffirmed in  Burnham v. Superior Court.  Consequently, Neff is not subject to jurisdiction in the Oregon suit, since he was not served with process in Oregon. B.  Under  International Shoe,  Neff\ufffds contacts in Oregon suffice to support personal jurisdiction over Neff for Mitchell\ufffds fees claim. If Neff returns to Oregon, Mitchell may serve him there with the papers in the action and then proceed with the suit. C.  Under  International Shoe,  Neff\ufffds contacts in Oregon suffice to support personal jurisdiction over him in any state for Mitchell\ufffds fees claim. D.  Under  International Shoe,  Neff\ufffds contacts in Oregon suffice to support personal jurisdiction over Neff in the Oregon action for Mitcheli\ufffds fees claim, even if he is not served in Oregon.",
            "Analysis": "A  is a real head scratcher. In  Burnham,  the Supreme Court did reaffirm that a court can still obtain personal jurisdiction over an individual defendant if she is served with process in the action in the forum state. So, if  Pennoyer  is still the law,  A  must be right . . . right? The flaw in this logic is that, while  Burnham  said that jurisdiction may still be asserted over an individual defendant served with process in the state, it did not say that this was  the only basis  on which such a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction. It\ufffds true, if Neff showed up in Oregon, Mitchell could still get jurisdiction over him by serving him with process in the action while he was there. But  International Shoe says that, if he does  not  return to Oregon, there\ufffds another basis on which he may be forced to defend an action there: if it arises out of voluntary contacts Neff made in Oregon.  Shoe,  in other words, added an alternative way to obtain personal jurisdiction over a defendant. If the claim arises out of in-state contacts, those contacts will support jurisdiction, even if the defendant (like Neff here) isn\ufffdt served with process in the state. On the other hand, if the defendant is served in the state, that provides a basis for jurisdiction, even if the claim did not arise there. B  suggests that, when the defendant bases jurisdiction on minimum contacts, the defendant must still be served with process in the forum state. If that were true,  International Shoe  wouldn\ufffdt be much help to plaintiffs: They\ufffdd still have to catch the defendant in the state. On the contrary, the beauty of  Shoe  is that, if the claim arises out of the defendant\ufffds in-state activities, the defendant is subject to jurisdiction on that claim, even if she assiduously stays away to avoid service. The court still has a basis for exercising jurisdiction\ufffdthe defendant\ufffds voluntary contacts there. As long as she is notified of the action in a reasonable manner\ufffdas here, by being served with process in California\ufffdshe is subject to jurisdiction under  Shoe,  not  Pennoyer. C  isn\ufffdt right either. The logic of  International Shoe  is that a defendant should realize that his activities in a state may give rise to claims and that it would not be unfair, would not violate due process, if suits that arise from the activities in that state are brought there. This means that a defendant with Oregon contacts should anticipate suits from those contacts in Oregon, but not in Montana, or Kansas. This concept is often referred to as \ufffd\ufffdspecific in personam jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd that is, jurisdiction limited to claims that arise from the contacts the defendant has voluntarily made in the state. A corollary is that, if you conduct limited activity in Oregon, you subject yourself to suit there only for claims that arise from your acts there. You can\ufffdt be sued there for North Dakota contacts, nor in North Dakota for these Oregon contacts. At some point, a defendant\ufffds contacts may become so substantial as to support \ufffd\ufffdgeneral in personam jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd for any claim, but limited or sporadic contact will only support specific in personam jurisdiction. So  D  is the best answer. Neff, though long gone, may be required to return and defend this claim, because it arises from his deliberate activity in Oregon\ufffdhiring Mitchell there to represent him and agreeing to pay him for his services.",

While *Burnham* reaffirms in-state service as a basis for jurisdiction {QC 1},  the question concerns whether jurisdiction exists even without in-state service {QC 6}.  Therefore, *Burnham* alone doesn't resolve the issue.\n\nStep 2: Option C is incorrect. *International Shoe* establishes minimum contacts as a basis for jurisdiction {QC 2}, but it does not allow jurisdiction in *any* state for claims arising from those contacts {QC 3}. Jurisdiction is limited to claims arising from the in-state activities.\n\nStep 3: Option D is incorrect. While *International Shoe* allows jurisdiction based on minimum contacts {QC 2}, it requires those contacts to be related to the claim {QC 3}.  The fact that Neff was served in California {QC 6} indicates that in-state service is not the basis for jurisdiction here.  The question is whether the minimum contacts are sufficient.\n\nStep 4: Option B correctly applies *International Shoe*. Neff's consultation with Mitchell in Oregon constitutes minimum contacts related to Mitchell's fee claim {QC 4, QC 5}.  The claim arises directly from Neff's Oregon activities {QC 3, QC 5}.  While Neff was not served in Oregon {QC 6},  the minimum contacts related to the claim exist {QC 2, QC 3}.  The option correctly states that if Neff returns to Oregon, he can be served there, establishing jurisdiction under *Burnham*, but this is not a requirement given the minimum contacts already established.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the correct answer is B.  Neff's Oregon contacts are sufficient to support jurisdiction under *International Shoe* for the fee claim, though service would ideally occur in Oregon.\n\nFinal Answer: B\n"

            "Context": "The nexus requirement: The myth of miscellaneous contacts International Shoe  established the proposition that a defendant\ufffds deliberate contacts in a state could support jurisdiction over her, even if she could not be served with process there in the action. But, where the defendant\ufffds contacts with the state are limited,  Shoe  established an important limitation on such jurisdiction: The plaintiff may only assert claims against the defendant that arise from those voluntary contacts. The idea is that the defendant, by establishing limited in-state contacts, submits to jurisdiction there for claims that arise from those contacts, but not for other, unrelated claims. Recall that, under  Pennoyer, the \ufffd\ufffdcontact\ufffd\ufffd of being served with process in the state subjected the defendant to suit for whatever claim the plaintiff had filed. But \ufffd\ufffdminimum contacts\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction is limited: It is only as broad as the defendant\ufffds in-state voluntary contacts themselves. A corollary of this is that a defendant can have contacts in a state, but not be subject to suit there on a particular claim. The following example illustrates this fundamental point. It may seem too simple, but I find that even after considerable repetition, a good many students have not fully grasped the meaning of \ufffd\ufffdspecific\ufffd\ufffd in personam jurisdiction.",
            "Question": "3. Minimum, or miscellaneous?  Cartwright is a carpenter who lives in Vermont and works out of his home there. In addition to his Vermont customers, he has some customers across the border in New York, and some in Massachusetts. Last year, he built a garage for a New York customer and put an addition on another New Yorker\ufffds house. This was about 5 percent of his construction business for the year, which is about the average for his New York business each year. While driving to a job in Massachusetts, Cartwright has an accident, in Massachusetts, with Morales, from New York. Morales brings suit against Cartwright for his injuries in a New York state court.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Cartwright is subject to personal jurisdiction in New York for this claim because he has minimum contacts in New York. B.  Cartwright is subject to personal jurisdiction in New York based on minimum contacts if New York has a long-arm statute that authorizes jurisdiction in tort cases. C.  Cartwright is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York, because the claim does not arise out of Cartwright\ufffds New York contacts. D.  Cartwright is not subject to personal jurisdiction in New York because his work in New York is a small percentage of his yearly construction business.",
            "Analysis": "The real culprit here is  A . Too many students have trouble with the basic point that, where jurisdiction is based on limited in-state contact, the claim  must arise out of the contact  to support personal jurisdiction. Miscellaneous contacts are not minimum contacts! Cartwright can\ufffdt be sued in New York for  any  claim because he has purposely chosen to do limited construction activity there. If his contacts in New York are limited, he is only subject to specific in personam jurisdiction in New York, that is, jurisdiction for claims that arise out of his New York activities. Since Morales\ufffds claim does not arise out of those New York activities,  Shoe  does not support personal jurisdiction for Morales\ufffds claim. If Morales sued Cartwright in Massachusetts for this claim, jurisdiction would be proper under  Shoe,  since the claim arises out of Cartwright\ufffds driving in Massachusetts. Or if a New York customer sued Cartwright in New York for doing shoddy carpentry on her garage, minimum contacts jurisdiction would also be proper, since the claim arises out of contacts in New York. B  represents another ever-so-common confusion about minimum contacts jurisdiction. I wish I had a nickel for every time a student has written that \ufffd\ufffdif the defendant doesn\ufffdt have minimum contacts with the state, he may be sued there if the long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction.\ufffd\ufffd It is true that, for a state court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, a statute of the state (for example, a section of a \ufffd\ufffdlong-arm\ufffd\ufffd statute) must authorize that exercise of jurisdiction. But the fact that a statute authorizes jurisdiction is not enough. It must  also be constitutionally permissible for the state to require the defendant to return and defend the particular suit that is brought there. No matter what the New York long-arm statute says, the New York court could not exercise jurisdiction over Cartwright if it would exceed due process limits to do so. For more on the relation of long-arm statutes to constitutional analysis, see  Chapter 7 , pp.  118-122. Here, suing Cartwright in New York for a claim that arose in Massachusetts based on his unrelated contacts in New York would not be constitutionally permissible, unless the New York contacts were so extensive as to support general in personam jurisdiction. Any exercise of personal jurisdiction must pass both tests: it must be authorized by statute  and  be consistent with constitutional standards. Just satisfying the long-arm statute will not do. The last answer,  D , is also wrong. It suggests that, in deciding whether the defendant\ufffds contacts in a state support jurisdiction, the court should consider the defendant\ufffds in-state activity relative to his total activity, and, if his in-state contact is a small percentage of his overall activity, refuse jurisdiction. But that isn\ufffdt so. For example, suppose that Cartwright drove to Massachusetts to look at a job, and had an accident with Morales on the way. Suppose he didn\ufffdt get the job, and that he had no other business in Massachusetts. He could still be sued in Massachusetts for Morales\ufffds accident, even if it represented .01 percent of his total economic activity for the year. He would still have deliberately entered the state and engaged in risk-creating activity there that gave rise to the claim. His contact would not be an unrelated, miscellaneous contact, but a minimum contact that gave rise to the claim. The analysis is not relative; it asks whether the defendant has engaged in purposeful activity in the state that gave rise to the claim, not whether he has engaged in more activity somewhere else. So, the fact that Cartwright\ufffds New York activity is a small part of his total business isn\ufffdt the point. If Morales\ufffds claim arose out of that limited New York activity, he would be able to sue Cartwright for the claim in New York. But it doesn\ufffdt arise out of those contacts. So  C  takes the prize.",

The basic premise of minimum contacts jurisdiction is that the defendant who chooses to relate to a state\ufffdwho \ufffd\ufffdpurposely avails\ufffd\ufffd herself of the opportunity to conduct activities there\ufffdcan expect to be sued there for claims that arise from that relationship. A suit there shouldn\ufffdt come as a surprise to her since she chose to relate to the state and can foresee this consequence of her conduct there.

In  World-Wide Volkswagen v.

It sells a replacement tank to Deuce Petroleum Company in Kansas, which has it mounted on the bed of its delivery truck and places it in service. As Ace was aware, Deuce delivers petroleum products to customers throughout the Midwest. While making a delivery in Illinois, the tank explodes, injuring Jack. Jack sues Ace Truck Bodies in Illinois for his injuries. Ace Truck has no contacts with Illinois other than those described in this question.

C.  subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois, because it committed a tortious act in Illinois under the long-arm statute. D.  not subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois, because its contacts with Illinois are insufficient to support jurisdiction over it under the minimum contacts test.",
            "Analysis": "In this case, Ace makes a product and sells it to a buyer in Kansas, who\ufffdas Ace knows\ufffdplans to use it in other states. The question is whether the act of selling the tank into Iowa, with knowledge or foreseeability that it would be used in nearby states, supports jurisdiction when its buyer proceeds to do so. Even if Ace had not known that Deuce would use the tank in Illinois, it certainly would not be surprised to learn that it did, since the very  raison d\ufffd\ufffdtre  of such a tank is to transport gasoline from place to place. C  takes the position that Ace is subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois, because it committed a tortious act there, when its tank exploded there. It may be true, under Illinois\ufffds interpretation of its long-arm statute, that Ace \ufffd\ufffdcommitted a tortious act\ufffd\ufffd there, but Ace still may only be sued there if it would be fair, under due process analysis, to make it appear and defend in Illinois. Personal jurisdiction in a state must be authorized by a statute, but it also must be within constitutional constraints. ( Chapter 7  explores this theme in more detail.) It is unlikely that such knowledge, or foreseeability, would satisfy due process standards for jurisdiction over Ace in Illinois for this claim. A  and  B  are inadequate answers, because Ace has not reached into Illinois to conduct activities there; Deuce has.  World-Wide  suggests a distinction between subjecting a seller to jurisdiction in states where it sells its product to an end user and states where that buyer  uses  them. Allowing jurisdiction wherever a buyer or third party took the product, World-Wide  suggests, would make the chattel the seller\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdagent for service of process,\ufffd\ufffd allowing suit in states where the defendant had not established deliberate contacts. Just as Seaway, in  World-Wide,  could foresee that the car it sold would travel to Oklahoma, Ace could foresee that its tank would be used by Deuce in Illinois.

Boyarin has not acted in Virginia and has no physical presence in the state. D.  The motion will likely be granted. Although MediSoft has extensive contacts in Virginia, the plaintiff\ufffds contacts in the state do not suffice to support personal jurisdiction.",
            "Analysis": "There\ufffds a certain diabolical pleasure in writing distractors. D  is bewitching; it is true that the plaintiff\ufffds contacts do not suffice to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant. The focus must be on the contacts of the defendant. In  International Shoe,  for example, the plaintiff, a state agency, certainly had plenty of contacts in Washington. But the  defendant had contacts too  that supported jurisdiction over it. In determining whether jurisdiction is proper, we look at the defendant\ufffds contacts. If she has none, she\ufffds not subject to jurisdiction. If she has established deliberate contacts in the forum state that give rise to the claim, she may be sued there, whether the plaintiff has contacts there or not. So  D  simply focuses on the wrong issue. See  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014) (contacts of plaintiff \ufffd\ufffdnot an appropriate consideration\ufffd\ufffd in determining minimum contacts). C  is also wrong. It suggests that the defendant must physically enter the state and act there to be subject to personal jurisdiction. This isn\ufffdt always necessary. A defendant may establish sufficient contacts with a state in various ways. In  McGee v. International Ins. Co.,  355 U.S. 220 (1957), for example, the defendant sent a letter to a Californian offering to reinsure him. That sufficed to support jurisdiction for a claim arising from that solicitation. In  Calder v. Jones,  465 U.S. 783 (1984), the defendant researched and wrote an article about a Californian to be published in California. That, too, was held sufficient to support jurisdiction, even if the defendant never entered the state in connection with the story. These and other cases establish that a defendant may purposely relate to a state\ufffdwithout going there\ufffdin a way that can lead her to anticipate the risk of litigation there. Here, Boyarin\ufffds contacts would meet that test. Boyarin deliberately contacted Mercy Hospital, in Virginia, in order to interfere with a contract between the hospital and the Virginia plaintiff.  B  is right, because Boyarin should not be surprised that her act had an adverse effect on MediSoft in Virginia, and that MediSoft would sue her there for this claim. Unlike Ace in the previous question, Boyarin initiated a contact with a Virginian, for the purpose of affecting a business decision involving Virginia commerce. Boyarin could hardly argue that she had never deliberately reached into Virginia. She did, for her own purposes, and could foresee that her Virginia-oriented act would have the kind of impact there that would lead to litigation. It is relevant, but not dispositive, that MediSoft is a Virginia company. That fact makes it clear to Boyarin that her call will have an impact in Virginia. Compare  Calder v. Jones,  465 U.S. 783 (1984), in which the Supreme Court noted that the defendant wrote an allegedly defamatory article about a California citizen whose career was centered there, so that the brunt of the harm would be suffered there. However, it is likely that MediSoft\ufffds loss of the contract in Virginia would support jurisdiction even if MediSoft were not a Virginia company, since Boyarin reached into the state to interfere with the contract there, and caused the loss of the contract with a Virginia customer by this deliberate act. A  suggests that Boyarin can be sued in Virginia if Compu-Drive, the company she works for, has extensive contacts there (thus presumably supporting general in personam jurisdiction). However, the contacts of the company will not all be attributed to Boyarin just because she works for it. Her contacts in the course of Compu-Drive\ufffds business  will  be attributed to the corporation, because in making those contacts she acts as an agent for the corporation. (How can a corporation have contacts in a state, other than through people who work for it?) But it doesn\ufffdt work the other way around: the contacts of the corporation will not always be attributed to its officers and employees. Suppose, for example, that another division of Compu-Drive, dealing with military software, has extensive business in Utah. It would not make sense to attribute those contacts to Boyarin, who did nothing in Utah and has nothing to do with this branch of Compu-Drive\ufffds business.",

            "Context": "The role of reasonableness in minimum contacts analysis There is a good deal of discussion in the Supreme Court\ufffds personal jurisdiction cases about the reasonableness of asserting personal jurisdiction over a defendant. In  McGee v. International Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220 (1957), for example, the Court noted that the increased ease of transportation and communication has reduced the inconvenience of defending an action in another state. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980), the Court stated that the burden of defending in a foreign state will be considered in light of other factors, including the plaintiff\ufffds interest in obtaining a remedy, the forum state\ufffds interest in adjudicating the dispute, and shared interests of the states in furthering substantive policies. And, in  Asahi Metal Industry v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102 (1987), the Court rejected jurisdiction over the impleaded Japanese defendant on reasonableness grounds, concluding that, even if it had minimum contacts with California (a point disputed among the Justices), it would be unreasonable to assert jurisdiction over Asahi on the facts of the case. Thus,  Asahi  stands for the proposition that in some cases, even if the defendant has established deliberate contacts in the state that gave rise to the plaintiff\ufffds claim, it will be unreasonable for the court to exercise jurisdiction over the defendant. In assessing reasonableness, a court should consider the plaintiff\ufffds interest in obtaining a convenient remedy, the forum state\ufffds interest in providing it, the extent of the inconvenience to the defendant, and other factors. But the opposite is also true: Sometimes, even if the interests of the state and the plaintiff would support taking jurisdiction, and even if it would not significantly inconvenience the defendant to do so, it may still be impermissible. Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. 444 U.S. at 294. If the defendant has  not  established contacts in the state, these other interests cannot substitute for contacts. First, the defendant must establish deliberate contacts focused on the forum state. If she has, the interests of the plaintiff and the forum state become relevant on the second prong of the test, whether it would be fair and reasonable to exercise jurisdiction. If she has not, these factors cannot in themselves support jurisdiction. Consider the following case.",
            "Question": "6. A matter of convenience.  Fein, from Wisconsin, meets Lonergan, a college classmate of her sister, while Fein is visiting her sister in Minnesota. Lonergan is a Minnesota auto salesman. They talk. Fein tells Lonergan that she is from Wisconsin. She agrees to buy an expensive Maserati from Lonergan, who deals in used cars out of his home in Minnesota, about 20 miles from the Wisconsin border. After returning home, Fein sends him a deposit check. Lonergan cashes the check, but does not buy the car, and never contacts Fein again. Fein sues him for fraud in Wisconsin. She chooses to sue at home in part because Wisconsin has a tough fraud statute, authorizing treble damages for fraud in auto sales transactions. The Wisconsin court",
            "Options": "Options: A.  will have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan if, as a matter of choice of law, it would apply the Wisconsin fraud statute to the transaction. B.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan, because Wisconsin has a strong interest (reflected in the statute) in protecting Wisconsin citizens from fraud. C.  will probably have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan because Fein has a strong interest in obtaining a remedy, Lonergan knew that Fein was from Wisconsin, and he will not be inconvenienced by litigation in Wisconsin, since he lives close to the border. D.  will probably not have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan.",
            "Analysis": "This question illustrates a case in which it would be reasonable for the court to exercise jurisdiction, considering the convenience of the parties and the interests of the plaintiff and the forum, but in which the court probably could not require the defendant to defend in Wisconsin. Fein has a strong interest in obtaining a remedy, and Wisconsin has an interest in protecting its citizens from fraud (though less interest than it would have if the fraud were perpetrated in Wisconsin). Wisconsin has established a powerful cause of action to redress such claims, and the Wisconsin court might, under choice-of-law principles, apply its statute to this transaction, which involved a Wisconsin buyer. Nor can Lonergan argue that he will be seriously inconvenienced by litigation in Wisconsin, since he lives and works fairly close by. However, it is unlikely that the Wisconsin court could exercise jurisdiction over Lonergan for this claim. It arises from negotiations in Minnesota for the purchase of a car in Minnesota. Although Lonergan knew Fein was from Wisconsin, he has not reached into Wisconsin to do business there. He has simply solicited a sale froma Wisconsin citizen in Minnesota. Thus  C  is probably wrong, since Lonergan never established \ufffd\ufffdaffiliating circumstances\ufffd\ufffd ( World-Wide,  444 U.S. at 295) that represent a deliberate choice to engage in activities focused on Wisconsin. A  suggests that Wisconsin would have personal jurisdiction over Lonergan if it would apply Wisconsin law to the transaction. However, the standards for applying a state\ufffds substantive law, under \ufffd\ufffdchoice-of- law\ufffd\ufffd rules, are distinct from the standards for exercising personal jurisdiction.  Hanson v. Denckla,  357 U.S. 235, 254 (1958). The fact that a defendant has entered into a transaction expecting forum law to apply would at least bolster the case for \ufffd\ufffdpurposeful availment,\ufffd\ufffd  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,  471 U.S. 462, 481-482 (1985), but that didn\ufffdt happen here\ufffdthe parties never discussed the matter. Yet, in some cases, a state could apply its own law to a case, but not have the power to assert jurisdiction over the defendant. For example, Oklahoma, as the place of the accident, might well apply its law to the accident in  World-Wide,  if it heard the case, yet the Supreme Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Seaway, the New York dealership. B  suggests that Wisconsin\ufffds interests in affording Fein a remedy, and in policing sales transactions, support jurisdiction over Lonergan. These interests would enter into the reasonableness calculus, if this claim arose out of contacts by Lonergan with Wisconsin, but they cannot support jurisdiction in the absence of minimum contacts. This disposes of  C  as well, which suggests that Wisconsin has jurisdiction because it would be a reasonable place to litigate the case. It is hard to see any basis for concluding that Lonergan availed himself of the opportunity to conduct activities focused on Wisconsin. Thus, since Lonergan fails the first prong, purposeful availment,  D  is the best answer.",

            "Context": "The erratic stream of commerce No one ever said that minimum contacts is simple. In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying  Shoe \ufffds general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed\ufffdor obfuscated\ufffdin  Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court,  480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in  J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro , 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. \ufffd\ufffdStream of commerce\ufffd\ufffd is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant\ufffds products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake\ufffds sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser\ufffds state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it ( not  where she took it, as  World-Wide  holds). See  World-Wide,  444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor\ufffds efforts to \ufffd\ufffdserve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states\ufffd\ufffd). But the Court later divided on this issue in  Asahi . In  Asahi,  the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O\ufffdConnor\ufffds opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O\ufffdConnor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part\ufffdor 100,000 parts\ufffdfrom Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer\ufffds state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such \ufffd\ufffdpurposeful availment\ufffd\ufffd if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts,  itself,  to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan\ufffds concurring opinion in  Asahi,  however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant\ufffds product in an American state,  even  indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes \ufffd\ufffdpurposeful availment\ufffd\ufffd in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that,  even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously\ufffdfor twenty- four years\ufffdfor the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in  J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro , 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In  Nicastro  the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy\ufffds plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not \ufffd\ufffdengaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey\ufffd\ufffd (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro\ufffds claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \ufffd\ufffdno jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\ufffd\ufffd And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither  Asahi  nor  McIntyre  provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.",
            "Question": "7. One end of the spectrum.  Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells five hundred drill presses to Emporia in 2011. Emporia resells three of them to Modern Tool and Die Company in Maryland. A local machine shop buys one from Modern, and Edwards, an employee, is injured using it in Maryland. He sues Atlanta Precision in state court in Maryland for his injuries. Atlanta Precision has no other contacts in Maryland. After the  Nicastro  decision the Maryland court will probably conclude that it",
            "Options": "Options: A.  has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it is an American company, unlike Asahi and J. McIntyre.

C.  has jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it sold its machines in large quantities to a distributor which it expected to resell in other states. D.  cannot exercise jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because its contacts with Maryland are insufficient under the minimum contacts test.",
            "Analysis": "This question explores the current state of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction after the Court\ufffds split decision in  J. McIntyre .  A  is not right. The logic of Justice Kennedy\ufffds opinion in  J. McIntyre  (echoing Justice O\ufffdConnor\ufffds approach in  Asahi ) is that the defendant did not purposely direct its sales activities to New Jersey, not that it was a foreign manufacturer. And Justice Breyer\ufffds concurring opinion in  J. McIntyre  relied on the minimal nature of the sales in New Jersey and the absence of other purposeful activity by J. McIntyre, not on the fact that J. McIntyre was a foreign manufacturer. In fact, both the plurality and concurring opinions expressed concern about the consequences for small domestic manufacturers if jurisdiction could be based on such minimal in-state sales. 564 U.S. at 885, 891. B  also fails. In both  Asahi  and  J. McIntyre  the manufacturer could foresee resales into the forum state, but that did not convince the Court to uphold jurisdiction. In both, the plurality opinions called for a deliberate effort by the defendant to serve the market  in that state , not just knowledge that its products might be resold there. And  C  is also dubious; the  Asahi  and  J. McIntyre  Courts did not base their opinions on the volume of sales from the manufacturer to the distributor. Both courts focused on the relation (or lack thereof) between the manufacturer and the state where the product was resold and caused injury. So  D  is the winner, Very likely, the Court\ufffdor, at least, a solid majority of six Justices\ufffdwould find this case governed by the decision in  J.

            "Context": "The meaning of general in personam jurisdiction. The previous chapter iterates, and reiterates, that jurisdiction based on a defendant\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdminimum contacts\ufffd\ufffd with the forum is limited to claims that arise out of those contacts. If a defendant conducts limited activities directed to the forum state, it is subject to \ufffd\ufffdspecific\ufffd\ufffd personal jurisdiction for claims arising out of those contacts, but not for other claims that arise in other states. However, in  International Shoe  the Court suggested that a defendant\ufffds contacts in the state may sometimes be so extensive that it could be sued there for any claim against it, no matter where it arose. \ufffd\ufffd[T]here have been instances in which the continuous corporate operations within a state were thought so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\ufffd\ufffd 326 U.S at 318. The premise behind general in personam jurisdiction is that, where a defendant\ufffds contacts are sufficiently extensive in the forum state, it is neither unfair nor inconvenient to require it to defend any lawsuit there, including ones that arise in other states. Thus, if International Shoe is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Missouri, it could be sued there for unemployment taxes due in Washington, or breach of a contract in Colorado. This is analogous to general in personam jurisdiction over an individual defendant based on her domicile in the state. In  Milliken v. Meyer,  311 U.S. 457 (1940), the Supreme Court affirmed that a person\ufffds domicile is such an important connection to a state, and confers sufficient benefits, that an individual domiciled in a state may fairly be required to defend any claim in that state. Let\ufffds start by distinguishing assertions of general in personam jurisdiction from other exercises of jurisdiction. Consider the following question.",
            "Question": "1. Line-up.  In which of the following cases could the court rely on general in personam jurisdiction as the basis for exercising judicial authority over the defendant?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Johnston brings an action in New Mexico against Moreno, a Texas citizen, for breach of a contract they entered into in Texas, in which Moreno agreed to sell Johnston a painting. He obtains jurisdiction by attaching a time share Moreno owns at a condominium complex in the New Mexico mountains. B.  Truscott sues Mancini Motors, a Texas corporation that sells antique cars at its dealerships in Texas and California. Truscott sues in New Mexico, for injuries he suffered in New Mexico while driving a 1964 Ford Mustang that Mancini had advertised in New Mexico, sold to Truscott, and shipped to him in New Mexico. Truscott serves Mancini with process in the action at the Texas dealership. Mancini has no place of business in New Mexico, but sells three or four cars a year there. C.  Truscott sues Mancini Motors, the Texas antique car company, in Texas. He seeks damages for misrepresentations a Mancini salesperson made to him at a Mancini dealership in California, which led him to purchase a car at the California dealership. D.  Cartwright sues Skilful Electric Tool Company in Michigan for injuries he suffered there using a Skilful saw he bought in Michigan. Skilful is incorporated in Delaware, manufactures its saws in Tennessee, where its home offices are, and sells its saws to wholesalers around the United States. Its main wholesaler, Statewide Distributors, is located in Michigan. Skilful sells 40 percent of its saws to Statewide, and ships them to Statewide in Michigan. Statewide sells at least half of those saws in Michigan.",
            "Analysis": "In  A , jurisdiction is not based on general in personam jurisdiction. Indeed, it is not based on in personam jurisdiction at all. It is an exercise of in rem jurisdiction, based not on bringing the defendant before the court, but upon the seizure of his property by attachment to satisfy an unrelated claim. More on this later in the chapter. Note too, that the defendant in this case is an individual. General in personam jurisdiction based on extensive contacts (as opposed to domicile) may not apply to individual defendants at all, but only to corporations. See Burnham v. Superior Court,  495 U.S. 604, 610 n.1 (1990). B  involves an exercise of specific in personam jurisdiction. Surely, selling a few cars a year in New Mexico is insufficient to support general in personam jurisdiction, which rests on the premise that the defendant conducts continuous, extensive activity in the forum state. However, Truscott\ufffds claim here arises out of a minimum contact of Mancini in New Mexico: advertising the car there and subsequently selling it to Truscott there. This would support specific in personam jurisdiction, since Truscott\ufffds claim arises out of a sale actively solicited by Mancini in New Mexico. D is also a specific in personam case. Here, Cartwright sues for a claim that arises out of sales of Skilful\ufffds products into Michigan. Even after  Asahi  and  McIntyre , Skilful would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Michigan for this claim since Skilful directly cultivated the Michigan market for its products by selling saws in quantity in Michigan, and Cartwright\ufffds claim arises from a product sold into Michigan. But Skilful\ufffds contacts would almost certainly not support general in personam jurisdiction in Michigan. In  Daimler A.G. v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117 (2014), the Supreme Court held that a corporation is only subject to general in personam jurisdiction in states where it is \ufffd\ufffdat home.\ufffd\ufffd In almost all cases,  Daimler  held, a corporation is \ufffd\ufffdat home\ufffd\ufffd only in the state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business. Michigan probably does not meet that test, even though Skilful does a lot of business there. Nor would Cartwright need to invoke general in personam jurisdiction, since the claim arises out of a Skilful contact in the forum. C  is different. Here, Truscott sues Mancini in Texas for a claim that arose from its activity in California. Mancini has plenty of contacts in Texas, but this claim does not arise from them. If the court is to exercise jurisdiction in the case, it will have to do so based on the fact that Mancini, which is incorporated in Texas and has a permanent place of business there, has extensive contacts in Texas that support general in personam jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over any claim against the corporation, even if it arose in another state.

            "Context": "What contacts suffice for general in personam jurisdiction? For many years it was exquisitely unclear what contacts of a defendant would suffice to support general in personam jurisdiction\ufffdagain, that means jurisdiction for claims that  did not  arise out of the defendant\ufffds contacts with the state in which the suit is brought. In  Perkins v. Benguet Mining Co. , 342 U.S. 437 (1952), the Supreme Court considered whether a corporation that had fled the Philippines during the Second World War and was conducting skeletal operations from its temporary Ohio headquarters, could be sued in Ohio for a claim that arose elsewhere. In Perkins , there was really no place other than Ohio where the plaintiff could bring the action. The Court upheld jurisdiction in the Ohio court under these unusual circumstances, but did not elucidate what other contacts would suffice to allow jurisdiction over a claim that did not arise in the forum. In  Helicopteros Nationales de Columbia S.A. v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408 (1984), the defendant bought helicopters from Texas, and had entered Texas for related training and to negotiate a contract to provide transport services using the helicopters. But it provided those services in South America, and the crash that gave rise to the plaintiffs\ufffd claims took place there. The Court held that the defendant\ufffds Texas contacts were insufficient to support general in personam jurisdiction. Since 2011, the Supreme Court has twice considered the reach of general in personam jurisdiction, in  Goodyear Dunlop Tire Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 U.S. 915 (2011), and in  Daimler A.G. v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117 (2014). In both cases, the Court endorsed the \ufffd\ufffdat home\ufffd\ufffd test as virtually the exclusive standard for assertions of general in personam jurisdiction, and held that a corporation is \ufffd\ufffdat home\ufffd\ufffd in its state of incorporation and the state of its principal place of business. These cases substantially clarified\ufffdand narrowed\ufffdthe scope of general in personam jurisdiction. Before them, many courts had exercised general in personam jurisdiction based on various extensive contacts in a state, such as extensive in-state facilities, employees, or sales. The Court in  Daimler did not quite foreclose the possibility that some extensive in-state contacts (other than incorporation and principal place of business) might support general in personam jurisdiction but suggested that in most cases such jurisdiction would be \ufffd\ufffdunacceptably grasping.\ufffd\ufffd 571 U.S. at 138. Let\ufffds try a question that considers both specific and general in personam jurisdiction, and both individual defendants and corporate defendants.",
            "Question": "2. Weight of authority.  Marathon Crane Company, an Iowa company with its home office and factory in Iowa, sold cranes to Partlett Construction Company, a South Dakota corporation. Marathon delivered the cranes to Partlett in South Dakota, but knew that Partlett did road construction throughout the Midwestern states. Over the past five years, Marathon has sold more than half of its cranes into Minnesota. Partlett took a Marathon crane from its yard in South Dakota to a job in Minnesota, where it collapsed, injuring Perez. Perez brought suit in Minnesota against Marathon for his injuries. In the same action, he asserted a claim against Francis, a Partlett supervisor who had negligently advised the crane operator\ufffd in South Dakota\ufffdthat the crane would lift 10,000 pounds, though it was actually rated for 3,000. Francis is a Minnesota citizen who works in Partlett\ufffds equipment yard in South Dakota. The Minnesota court",
            "Options": "Options: A.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon based on general jurisdiction. B.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon based on specific jurisdiction, since Marathon knew that Partlett used Marathon cranes in all Midwestern states. C.  has personal jurisdiction over Marathon because, unlike in  Asahi , it would not be unreasonable to require Marathon to come from nearby South Dakota to Minnesota. D.  lacks personal jurisdiction over either defendant. E.  has general in personam jurisdiction over Francis, but does not have in personam jurisdiction over Marathon.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds go through the choices in order.  A  is clearly wrong after  Daimler , which holds that general in personam jurisdiction over a corporation will almost always be limited to its state of incorporation and principal place of business. Even though more than half of Marathon\ufffds cranes are sold into Minnesota,  Daimler  suggests that general in personam jurisdiction would be \ufffd\ufffdunacceptably grasping,\ufffd\ufffd since Minnesota is not Marathon\ufffds state of incorporation or its principal place of business. It is also doubtful that Marathon would be subject to specific jurisdiction for this claim. While it knew that Partlett would use its cranes in other states, it sold this one into South Dakota. If it could be sued in any state where Partlett used the crane, that would make the crane Partlett\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdagent for service of process.\ufffd\ufffd Taking the crane to Minnesota was a deliberate contact of Partlett with Minnesota, not Marathon. So  B  is not the best choice. C  also fails. While it would be less onerous to bring Marathon to Minnesota than it would be to bring Asahi to California, personal jurisdiction analysis must start with some connection of the defendant with the forum state that supports jurisdiction. Here, Marathon\ufffds contacts are insufficient to support general jurisdiction and the claim does not arise out of the contacts it has there. Very likely, it lacks sufficient contacts to support jurisdiction. If that is true, the court would not reach the reasonableness prong of the analysis. Lack of inconvenience, or the interest of the forum and the plaintiff in bringing suit in Minnesota, will not support jurisdiction there if the defendant does not have a relationship with the state that supports jurisdiction.  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 294 (1980). D  is wrong, because the court has jurisdiction over Francis based on his domicile in Minnesota. In  Milliken v. Meyer , 311 U.S. 457 (1940), the Supreme Court upheld jurisdiction over a domiciliary of a state, even for claims that arose outside the state. Thus, Francis is subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota, whether or not the claim arose out of any act he directed to Minnesota. One might argue that his mistake in advising about the weight limit would support specific jurisdiction if he knew the crane would be used in Minnesota. But we needn\ufffdt resolve that question, since Francis can be sued in Minnesota for any claim. So  E  is the best answer. Francis could be sued in Minnesota for any claim, but Marathon very likely could not be sued there based on specific or general in personam jurisdiction.",

            "Context": "General in personam jurisdiction and principal place of business As  Chapter 2  explains, for purposes of  diversity jurisdiction , a corporation is deemed a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1). And now,  Goodyear  and  Daimler  approve general in personam jurisdiction in a corporation\ufffds state of incorporation and principal place of business. This means the concept of \ufffd\ufffdprincipal place of business\ufffd\ufffd is relevant to both subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction. So, we need to consider just what that phrase means, and whether it means the same thing in both contexts. In  Hertz Corp. v. Friend , 559 U.S. 77 (2010), the Supreme Court held that a corporation\ufffds principal place of business  for diversity purposes  is, in all cases, the state of its headquarters. After  Hertz , a corporation is a citizen, under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1), of the state in which its headquarters are located, even if all of its actual manufacturing or service activities take place elsewhere. The Court emphasized the importance of having a relatively clear rule that will avoid uncertainty and litigation about whether diversity jurisdiction is met in cases involving corporate parties. And in  Goodyear  and  Daimler , the Court suggested that general in personam jurisdiction will be proper in a corporation\ufffds state of incorporation and its principal place of business. However, we don\ufffdt know that the Court will use the  Hertz  test as the test for \ufffd\ufffdprincipal place of business\ufffd\ufffd for purposes of general in personam jurisdiction! Perhaps it will look, in this different context, to the state where the most productive activity takes place rather than the corporate headquarters. It seems somewhat unlikely that it would simply borrow the  Hertz  standard, since the policies underlying diversity and personal jurisdiction analysis are different. So it is important to analyze diversity jurisdiction and general in personam jurisdiction separately, recognizing that the \ufffd\ufffdprincipal place of business\ufffd\ufffd concept may mean different things in these two contexts. To emphasize the point, consider the following, slightly wacky question.",
            "Question": "3. The quality of contacts.  Pontes, an Ohio citizen, is injured in an accident with Swedenbourg, who is driving a truck for her employer, Quality Auto Parts, Inc.

Its sales are spread around the Midwest: 55 percent of its sales are in Ohio, 18 percent are in Indiana, 11 percent are in Illinois, and the rest are scattered among six other states, including South Dakota. It manufactures $50 million worth of auto parts each year at its factory in Ohio. Pontes sues Quality for her injury in a federal court in Ohio. The Ohio court will",
            "Options": "Options: A.  have personal jurisdiction over Quality under the  Hertz  case. B.  have personal jurisdiction over Quality under the  Daimler  case. C.  have subject matter jurisdiction over the case under the  Daimler  decision. D.  have subject matter jurisdiction over the case based on diversity. It may also have personal jurisdiction over Quality for this claim, but we don\ufffdt know for sure.",
            "Analysis": "Before we get down to the choices here, note that the fact that the case is brought in federal court does not change the analysis. In most cases, the federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant to the same extent as the state courts in the state in which they sit, under Fed R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). It would be constitutionally permissible for federal courts to exercise broader jurisdiction, but the rule confines them in most cases to the reach of jurisdiction under the local state long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment. See J. Glannon, Civil Procedure: Examples & Explanations  113-114 (8th ed. 2018). The point of this question is that the standard for determining whether a corporation\ufffds contacts in a state will support general in personam jurisdiction is  not the same  as determining its state citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. For purposes of  subject matter jurisdiction  based on diversity of citizenship, a corporation is a citizen of the state where it is incorporated and the state where its principal place of business is located. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1). And a corporation\ufffds principal place of business  for diversity purposes  is generally its corporate headquarters, under  Hertz Corp. v. Friend , 559 U.S. 77 (2010). But \ufffd1332(c)(1) has nothing to do with where a corporation is subject to general in personam jurisdiction. True, after  Daimler , it is clear that a corporation\ufffds activities in the state of its principal place of business will support general in personam jurisdiction. However, that does not mean that courts will use the  Hertz test to determine a corporation\ufffds principal place of business for purposes of general in personam jurisdiction. These concepts are confusingly similar, but not identical. So let\ufffds consider the choices.  A  just has to be wrong, because the Hertz  test is used to determine a corporation\ufffds principal place of business under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1), for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, which is  subject matter jurisdiction . Maybe the Supreme Court will one day endorse the same test for a corporation\ufffds principal place of business for general in personam jurisdiction. But it hasn\ufffdt done that yet and may never do that. B  is very probably wrong. Quality has extensive contacts in Ohio, but probably is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction there after Daimler.  That case left open the narrow possibility that a corporation\ufffds contacts in a state\ufffdapart from incorporation or principal place of business\ufffdwould support general in personam jurisdiction, but the language in  Daimler  suggests that this is unlikely in a case like this, just based on the bulk of contacts being in one state. At least, it is far from a sure thing that Quality\ufffds contacts would support general in personam jurisdiction, so this is not the best answer. C  is the real loser.  Daimler  says nothing whatsoever about subject matter jurisdiction, even though it discusses two concepts\ufffdincorporation and principal place of business\ufffdthat apply in diversity analysis as well. This distractor mixes apples with oranges and will only be chosen by the (understandably) confused. D  is the best answer. Under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(c)(1), Quality is a citizen of its state of incorporation\ufffdDelaware\ufffdand of its principal place of business. And  Hertz  tells us that its principal place of business,  for diversity purposes,  is the state of its home office, which is Indiana. So it is diverse from Pontes, an Ohio citizen, even though Quality has a huge manufacturing presence in Ohio. But we don\ufffdt know if it is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Ohio.  Daimler  tells us that Quality is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Delaware\ufffdits state of incorporation\ufffdand also in the state of its principal place of business. Perhaps the Court would hold that Ohio is Quality\ufffds principal place of business, since Quality makes millions of dollars worth of goods there and sells most of them there as well. Or, perhaps it will adopt the  Hertz test to determine a corporation\ufffds principal place of business  for general in personam jurisdiction purposes as well . Or, perhaps it will adopt the Hertz  test for \ufffd\ufffdprincipal place of business,\ufffd\ufffd but hold that a corporation is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in other states as well if it has really predominant contacts there, like Quality\ufffds Ohio contacts in this question. At this point, we really don\ufffdt know, so go with  D .",

            "Context": "The historical role of in rem jurisdiction Unlike jurisdiction \ufffd\ufffdin personam,\ufffd\ufffd that is, over the person of the defendant, \ufffd\ufffdin rem\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over a thing, an item of property. As  Pennoyer v. Neff  explains, for many years courts proceeded on the premise that their authority to exercise jurisdiction was based on physical power. A court could exercise jurisdiction over a person within the territory of the state (\ufffd\ufffdin personam jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd) if he was symbolically arrested there through service of process. Or the court could exercise jurisdiction over property within the state (\ufffd\ufffdin rem jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd) if the property was seized through attachment. The process for seizure of property through attachment varied from state to state, and for different types of property. Usually, land was (and still is) attached by obtaining a writ of attachment from the court and filing it in the registry of deeds or other office for recording titles, and perhaps posting notice of the attachment on the property as well. This gives notice to the world that the court has assumed jurisdiction over the property and might enter an order affecting its title. For tangible personal assets, the property may be taken into custody by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of attachment issued by the court, or a keeper appointed to retain control of the property pending further order from the court. Attachment provided an alternative means to satisfy claims of local citizens when the defendant could not be sued there in personam. Suppose, for example, that Neff hired Mitchell, an Oregon lawyer, to represent him in a divorce case in Oregon, but moved to California without paying Mitchell\ufffds fee. Under the jurisdictional principles of Pennoyer v. Neff,  Neff could not be sued in personam in Oregon, since he could not be served with process there. However, if he had left property in the state, the court could assert jurisdiction over that property by attaching it. It could then adjudicate Mitchell\ufffds fees claim, and if it concluded that Neff owed the fee (or if Neff defaulted), it could order Neff\ufffds property sold to satisfy Mitchell\ufffds claim. Thus, in rem jurisdiction provided an alternative means of satisfying a claim, if the defendant had obligingly left property subject to attachment in the forum state. Often, however, the in rem alternative would not be fully satisfactory. Because the court\ufffds authority to adjudicate was based on its seizure of property, not power over the defendant personally, it could only dispose of the property before it. If the court determined that Mitchell was owed $300, but Neff\ufffds attached property sold for $200, the court could not enter an order requiring Neff to pay the other $100. To do so would be to exercise jurisdiction over Neff personally, but Neff wasn\ufffdt before the court; only the property was. So, the in rem remedy was limited to the value of the property the court had attached at the outset of the case. 1 Even if the property was worth less than the plaintiff\ufffds claim, however, an in rem action placed the defendant in a difficult position. Consider the following example.",
            "Question": "4. Hostage-taking.  In the era before  International Shoe  and  Shaffer v. Heitner,  Mitchell sues Neff in Oregon for a $20,000 legal fee. Neff claims that he had already paid the fee, but Mitchell claims that his payment was for other services. Neff lives in California and cannot be served with process in Oregon. However, he had left his Model T in the garage at his brother\ufffds house in Bend, Oregon. Mitchell obtains a writ of attachment and has the Model T, worth $6,000, seized by the sheriff. Neff receives notice of the suit and the attachment, and consults you for advice on how to respond to the suit and the attachment. Which advice would be most appropriate?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Neff should ignore the action, since he is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Oregon. B.  Neff should ignore the action, and resist enforcement of any resulting judgment in California. C.  Neff should file a special appearance in Oregon claiming that he is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. D.  Neff should appear and defend the underlying claim, to avoid losing his Model T.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds work through the consequences to Neff of making each choice. If he chooses  A , and ignores the action, the Oregon court will enter a default judgment for Mitchell, and order his Model T sold. Mitchell will get the proceeds of the sale. It probably won\ufffdt be a full $6,000, because buying at a sheriff\ufffds sale always carries some risk that the procedure may not have been proper, which could give rise to a claim by the prior owner\ufffdthat\ufffds what gave rise to Pennoyer\ufffds troubles. But Neff will be out one Model T. If, as the question indicates, he has a viable defense to the underlying fees claim, he would be ill-advised to take that course. B  is dreadful advice, because there wouldn\ufffdt be any action brought in California to enforce the Oregon judgment. An in rem judgment operated only against the property, not against Neff personally. So it could only be executed by sale of the attached property in Oregon. Mitchell could not seek further satisfaction from Neff based on the in rem judgment. Here again, Neff loses his Model T. C  would also be pointless, because the Oregon court is not exercising personal jurisdiction over Neff. It is exercising in rem jurisdiction over his property instead. Prior to  Shaffer v. Heitner,  this was conceptually different, and could be done even if Neff was not subject to personal jurisdiction. In fact, that was frequently  why  it was done. So it makes no sense for Neff to come in and object to personal jurisdiction. So  D  seems like the only sensible course. If Neff has a viable defense to the underlying fees claim, and he doesn\ufffdt want to lose the Model T, he will have to appear and defend the action. This illustrates the potential power of an in rem action under traditional practice: Property left in the state could serve as a hostage to force the defendant back into the forum. Suppose that Neff did return to defend the Oregon action, to avoid losing his Ford. Would he, by doing so, submit to full personal jurisdiction? Not necessarily. A good many states allowed a defendant in Neff\ufffds position to enter a \ufffd\ufffdlimited appearance\ufffd\ufffd to protect his property from sale. He could appear and defend the fees claim on the merits without submitting to personal jurisdiction. Consequently, if he lost on the fees claim, the court could order sale of the attached assets, but it could not enter a personal judgment against Neff for any remaining balance. See R. Freer,  Civil Procedure  291 (3d ed. 2012). If local state law authorized such a limited appearance, his exposure was limited to the value of the attached property.",

Suppose, for example, that the title to a piece of real estate is disputed, and the owner wishes to sell it. She might bring an action to determine title to the property, give notice to known claimants individually, and publish notice to unknown claimants (the best notice possible to unknown parties who might hold an interest in the property). The court would then determine all interests in the property, so that it could be conveyed with a clear title. Any other claims to the property, known or unknown, would be extinguished by the court\ufffds decree. Another example of a \ufffd\ufffdpure\ufffd\ufffd in rem action is an action to forfeit property to the government. Forfeiture is used by the federal government, for example, to obtain title to goods imported illegally, and, more recently, property used in or purchased with the proceeds of drug transactions. In forfeiture actions, the property itself is \ufffd\ufffdthe defendant.\ufffd\ufffd These cases end up in the reporters with names like  \ufffd\ufffdUnited States v. 23 Cases of Jack Daniels Whiskey,\ufffd\ufffd  or, to cite an actual case,  United States v. Cadillac Sedan Deville,  933 F.2d 1010 (6th Cir. 1991). Here again, the purpose of the action is to confirm the government\ufffds title to the subject property. The property is both the subject of the action and the source of the court\ufffds authority to adjudicate. The court proceeds even if it lacks personal jurisdiction over some or all claimants to the property, since it has power over the property based on its presence in the district. Such in rem forfeiture actions remain common today. See generally M. Harrington, \ufffd\ufffdRethinking  In Rem:  The Supreme Court\ufffds New (and Misguided) Approach to Civil Forfeiture,\ufffd\ufffd 12 Yale L. & Pol\ufffdy Rev. 281 (1994). A second type of in rem jurisdiction is often referred to as \ufffd\ufffdquasi in rem jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdquasi in rem type I jurisdiction.\ufffd\ufffd See  Shaffer v. Heitner , 433 U.S. 186, 199 n.17 (1977). This type also involves disputes as to title to property. Unlike pure in rem jurisdiction, however, the action only seeks to \ufffd\ufffdsecure a preexisting claim in the subject property and to extinguish or establish the nonexistence of similar interests of particular persons.\ufffd\ufffd Id. In other words, in this type of action the party bringing the action asserts that, \ufffd\ufffdas to this particular parcel of land, or this automobile, Smith, my interest is superior to yours.\ufffd\ufffd It does not affect  other  potential claimants\ufffd interests in the property, but simply seeks a declaration that, as between the party bringing the action and a particular other contender, the plaintiff\ufffds claim is superior. An example is an action to foreclose a mortgage. In a foreclosure action, the bank does not seek to have all other interests in the property determined or extinguished. It simply seeks a decree that its interest in the mortgaged property is superior to the mortgagor\ufffds, due to nonpayment, and an order for sale of the property to satisfy its superior claim. As in \ufffd\ufffdtrue\ufffd\ufffd in rem cases, the parties to a type I action assert  preexisting  claims to the property before the court, and ask the court to sort those preexisting claims out. The third type, called \ufffd\ufffdquasi in rem type II jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdattachment jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd is analytically different. In a case commenced by attachment, the party bringing the action has a claim against the defendant  having nothing to do with the property attached.  \ufffd\ufffdIn attachment jurisdiction, the basis of jurisdiction is the existence of property owned by the defendant. Attachment jurisdiction is also to be contrasted with in rem jurisdiction, where the purpose of the action is to resolve conflicting claims to the property; in attachment jurisdiction both parties accept that the property is owned by defendant but plaintiff wants to expropriate it to pay his [unrelated] claim.\ufffd\ufffd Ehrenzweig, Louisell & Hazard,  Jurisdiction in a Nutshell, State and Federal  40-41 (4th ed. 1980). For example, Mitchell might bring a quasi in rem type II action against Neff in Oregon to recover the legal fees for his work on Neff\ufffds divorce. Unable to obtain jurisdiction over Neff personally, he might attach land Neff owned in Oregon. He does not seek the attachment to assert any preexisting interest in the land; indeed, the very reason to attach it is that Neff does own it. Instead, Mitchell asks the court to exert jurisdiction over the property to establish a basis for the court to adjudicate the unrelated fees claim. The seizure of the land through attachment gives the court a jurisdictional base and an asset to sell to satisfy Mitchell\ufffds fees claim. Similarly, Ortiz, seeking contract damages for Neff\ufffds failure to deliver goods under a contract, might sue Neff and attach Neff\ufffds property, to give the court a basis to adjudicate the unrelated contract claim. In these cases, the party bringing the action, unable to sue the defendant in personam, resorts to the alternative illustrated by  Question 4 . He sues the defendant and seeks seizure of her property, to give the court a basis to adjudicate a claim unrelated to the attached property. The property is not the subject of the action, it is a hostage for the defendant. Consider the following example on the three types of in rem jurisdiction.",
            "Question": "5. Quasi-distinctions.  Which of the following cases involves an exercise of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux\ufffds house in Iowa. She brings an action against Roux in Iowa for her injuries and serves him personally with notice of the action. B.  Ohora is injured in Iowa in a collision with Roux, from Iowa. She brings an action against Roux in Nebraska for her injuries, and obtains a writ of attachment in the action on a Nebraska farm owned by Roux. C.  Ohora, a Nebraska lawyer, is hired by Roux, from Iowa, to represent him in acquiring a farm in Nebraska. Roux leaves the state and fails to pay Ohora for her services. Ohora sues him for her fee in Nebraska and has him served with notice of the action in Iowa. D.  Consolidated Equipment Company sells Roux a construction crane in Iowa, on an installment contract, subject to a right of repossession for nonpayment. Roux fails to pay. Consolidated brings an action in Nebraska to repossess the crane, and obtains a writ from the court attaching the crane while it is at a job site in Nebraska.",
            "Analysis": "This question requires you to apply the basic distinction between quasi in rem type II jurisdiction and other exercises of jurisdiction. The case in  A  arises out of Roux\ufffds ownership of property, but it is not an in rem action of any type. Ohora has simply brought an in personam action against Roux for her personal injury claim. The fact that the claim arises out of the ownership of real property does not mean that the action must be brought by attachment, and here it has not been. The third case,  C , is also an action in personam against Roux. It arises out of legal services related to the Nebraska farm, but the farm is not attached in connection with the action as an asset from which to satisfy Ohora\ufffds claim. There is a difference between bringing an action against Roux personally for a claim that relates to a piece of property, which Ohora has done here, and proceeding by seizure of an asset to provide the court a basis for adjudicating an unrelated claim. D  involves an assertion of quasi in rem type I jurisdiction. Consolidated claims that it has an interest in the crane under the installment contract that takes priority over Roux\ufffds interest. It asks the court to confirm this claim and its entitlement to repossess the crane. The action in  B  is an exercise of quasi in rem type II jurisdiction. Ohora sues Roux in Nebraska for an injury in Iowa. There would probably not be specific in personam jurisdiction over Roux in Nebraska for this claim. Instead, Ohora attaches Nebraska real estate owned by Roux. The property attached is not the subject matter of the suit. Ohora doesn\ufffdt claim that she has any preexisting interest in the farm, or that the claim relates to it. She merely invokes the court\ufffds power to seize and sell it to satisfy Ohora\ufffds unrelated claim against Roux, should it find her claim valid. So,  B  is right.",

            "Context": "The impact of  Shaffer v. Heitner Over the years from  Pennoyer v. Neff  to  Shaffer v. Heitner,  attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically \ufffd\ufffdpresent\ufffd\ufffd in a particular place. Harris v. Balk,  198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In  Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\ufffds debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\ufffds debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \ufffd\ufffdseized\ufffd\ufffd in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\ufffds debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\ufffds claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\ufffds claim. Shaffer  involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\ufffds business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \ufffd169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\ufffdand was granted\ufffda court order seizing (\ufffd\ufffdsequestering\ufffd\ufffd) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in  Harris v. Balk,  Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\ufffds seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\ufffds ploy in  Harris,  this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\ufffdvery type II. In  Shaffer,  the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases \ufffd\ufffdsupports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.\ufffd\ufffd 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants\ufffd property was merely an \ufffd\ufffdelliptical way\ufffd\ufffd of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: \ufffd\ufffdWe therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in  International Shoe  and its progeny.\ufffd\ufffd 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from  Shaffer  means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let\ufffds take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.",
            "Question": "6.  Shaffer  survivors?  In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court\ufffds decision in  Shaffer v. Heitner ?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux\ufffds summer house in Nebraska. She sues Roux in Nebraska for her injuries and asserts jurisdiction by obtaining a writ of attachment on the property on which she was injured. B.  Ohora brings an action to quiet title to her Nebraska farm in a Nebraska court. She gives notice of the action by mail to Roux, who lives in New York but claims a one-third interest in the farm inherited from a great aunt. She also gives notice by publication to unknown claimants to the property. C.  Consolidated Equipment Company sells Roux a construction crane in Iowa, on an installment contract, subject to a right of repossession for nonpayment. Roux fails to pay. Consolidated brings an action in Nebraska to obtain clear title to the crane, and obtains a writ from the court attaching the crane while present on a job in Nebraska. D.  All of the above. E.  None of the above.",
            "Analysis": "In his majority opinion, Justice Marshall suggested that exercises of in rem jurisdiction would have to be measured by the same standards as exercises of in personam jurisdiction. Thus, attachment jurisdiction is not dead. It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In  A , the plaintiff was injured on the defendant\ufffds property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska\ufffdmaintenance of his property there\ufffdhe could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction. Thus, this exercise of jurisdiction meets International Shoe  jurisdictional standards, and Ohora may proceed by attaching the property under an attachment statute if she chooses to do so. In  Shaffer , Justice Marshall notes that the minimum contacts test will usually be met in such cases. See 433 U.S. at 208. One might legitimately wonder why Ohora would choose to proceed by attachment, which only brings the defendant\ufffds property before the court, rather than suing Roux in personam, which would support a personal judgment for the full amount of Ohora\ufffds injuries. Presumably, Ohora  would  sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant\ufffds in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see  Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc.,  575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978). B  is a \ufffd\ufffdpure\ufffd\ufffd in rem action to quiet title to real property. Under the broad holding of the  Shaffer  majority, such actions would have to meet the personal jurisdiction standards of  International Shoe.  And they usually would, since the suit involves title to property within the forum state. Because it arises from ownership of an interest in land in Nebraska, claimants to the property will have a minimum contact in Nebraska that gives rise to the claim. Since the court could proceed in personam, it may proceed based on jurisdiction over the property instead. This one is OK. The trend seems pretty clear here, doesn\ufffdt it.  C  is an exercise of quasi in rem type I jurisdiction. Here again, the claim is to property present in the forum. Since the case involves conflicting ownership interests in property in Nebraska, the court would quite likely have jurisdiction over the claimants under the minimum contacts test. Thus,  D  is the best answer. Each of these exercises of in rem jurisdiction is permissible, even after  Shaffer v. Heitner.",

            "Context": "The need for a constitutional and a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction Let\ufffds start with the role of the United States Constitution in defining the limits of a court\ufffds power to subject a defendant to jurisdiction. The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property \ufffd\ufffdwithout due process of law,\ufffd\ufffd that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it\ufffds a court that\ufffds doing the depriving\ufffdby entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it\ufffdbasic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have \ufffd\ufffda basis to exercise personal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as  International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler ,  Asahi ,  Burnham v. Superior Court , and  Bristol-Myers Squibb , the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state, 1  being \ufffd\ufffdat home\ufffd\ufffd in a state, 2  minimum contacts that give rise to the claim, 3  and service of process on an individual in the forum state. 4  That\ufffds not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets  limits  on the exercise of jurisdiction. (\ufffd\ufffdNo state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\ufffd\ufffd) It says to the states, \ufffd\ufffdgo ahead, define your courts\ufffd jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don\ufffdt overreach.\ufffd\ufffd It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, 5  and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\ufffds rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps.  First,  they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant.  Second,  if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.",

            "Analysis": "It shouldn\ufffdt be too hard to narrow down the choices here. The statute requires that the defendant, when she commits the tortious act, be physically present in Acadia. Margules wasn\ufffdt, so the statute does not authorize the Acadia court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Margules. That eliminates  A  right off the bat. B  asserts that the statute does not authorize the court to hear the case, and that, if it did, it would exceed constitutional bounds to exercise jurisdiction over Margules on these facts. This is almost certainly not so. Margules deliberately reached into Acadia to cause a substantial adverse effect on Perrone in Acadia, and did. A person need not physically enter a state to establish a minimum contact there that will support personal jurisdiction over her. She need only purposely engage in conduct focused on the state that she can foresee might cause adverse effects there and lead to litigation there. Margules certainly did that, and it would not be unreasonable to require her to defend this Acadia-focused act in Acadia. Compare  Calder v. Jones,  465 U.S. 783 (1984) (Florida defendant who wrote defamatory article about California actress published there subject to personal jurisdiction in California, even if he did not travel to California in connection with the article). How about  D , which suggests that the court can exercise jurisdiction because Margules\ufffds minimum contacts in Acadia would constitutionally allow the court to do so? This dangerously misconstrues the relation of jurisdictional statutes and constitutional constraints. Although it would be consistent with due process for Acadia to require Margules to defend this case in Acadia, it has  chosen not to require him to.  Instead, it has written a long-arm statute that does not \ufffd\ufffdreach to the limits of due process.\ufffd\ufffd In this long-arm provision, Acadia has granted its courts less personal jurisdiction authority than it constitutionally could, by excluding cases like Perrone\ufffds, in which communications from outside the state defame a plaintiff in the state. Maybe it just doesn\ufffdt want to hear all these cases. For whatever reason, it has not given its courts statutory authority to hear this claim, even though it could have.  C  is the best answer.",

So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes, 5  and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\ufffds rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps.  First,  they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant.  Second,  if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.",

            "Analysis": "Those of you who have read  McGee v. International Ins. Co.,  355 U.S. 220 (1957), will recognize this question as a twist on the facts of McGee. But the resemblance is superficial. D  can\ufffdt be right. It asserts that the Utah statute doesn\ufffdt authorize jurisdiction, but by its terms it does. It authorizes a policy beneficiary residing in Utah to sue on the policy in Utah. McGee\ufffds a beneficiary, she\ufffds suing in Utah, she\ufffds suing on the policy. The statute authorizes the court to exercise jurisdiction. The real question is whether Utah could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction over the company based solely on the residence of a beneficiary in the state. (The statute is hypothetical.) C  provides a preview of a point covered in more detail below. It suggests that the reach of personal jurisdiction in this case would be broader if the suit were brought in a Utah federal court. This is a common, understandable misconception about personal jurisdiction. Generally, the federal courts do not exercise wider personal jurisdiction than the courts of the state in which they sit. Rule 4(k)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules, effectively a long-arm statute for the federal courts, provides that, in most cases (including diversity cases) the federal court will exercise jurisdiction over a case only if the courts of the state in which it sits could do so. There are some exceptions to this (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(B), (C), (D)), but in most cases Rule 4(k)(1)(A) restricts the Utah federal courts to the same reach of personal jurisdiction as the state courts of Utah. So, McGee would fare no better by filing in a Utah federal court than she would in Utah state court. So  C  loses. B  asserts that the Utah statute authorizes jurisdiction, and that it would likely be constitutional for the court to exercise it. This is very dubious. United Assurance only does business in the southeastern states. It sold a policy to Nhan in North Carolina. Nhan\ufffds decision to designate his mother from Utah as a beneficiary is a contact of Nhan with Utah, not \ufffd\ufffdpurposeful availment\ufffd\ufffd by United Assurance of the opportunity to conduct activities in Utah. I haven\ufffdt researched the cases, but this seems like overreaching under basic minimum contacts principles. Otherwise, insurance companies would effectively be subject to nationwide jurisdiction based on the residency of the beneficiaries chosen by the insured. That might be a good thing but doesn\ufffdt reflect current personal jurisdiction doctrine. So  A  survives the process of elimination. The question illustrates the situation\ufffdnot as atypical as one might expect\ufffdin which the legislature has authorized jurisdiction that, in at least some cases, would exceed the bounds of due process.",

What role can the statute play in later cases? D  takes the position that the statute has been declared unconstitutional, and thus is defunct, has been stricken from the books. But this isn\ufffdt the effect of the holding in McGee\ufffds case. The court held here that it would be unconstitutional to apply the statute in McGee\ufffds case, because, on those facts, United Assurance had no sufficient relation to Utah to support jurisdiction over it for McGee\ufffds claim. However, the court did not hold that the statute could never be applied in  any  case, only that it would exceed due process bounds to apply it to McGee\ufffds. When a court holds that a particular application of a long-arm statute would exceed constitutional bounds, it does not strike down the statute itself. It simply refuses to apply it to circumstances in which the exercise of jurisdiction would be unconstitutional. The statute remains on the books; it has not been held unconstitutional on its face, that is, invalid for all applications. It has been held unconstitutional as applied to a particular set of facts. It remains in effect, and may be applied in other cases where doing so would not exceed constitutional bounds. So  D  is wrong. The statute isn\ufffdt defunct, and the court in Poretto\ufffds case will consider whether it may assert jurisdiction under it without violating due process standards. But wouldn\ufffdt  stare decisis  require the court in Poretto\ufffds case to hold the same way as the court did in McGee\ufffds? No, because the question in McGee\ufffds case is different from the question in Poretto\ufffds. The question in McGee\ufffds case was whether it would be constitutional to apply the statute on the facts of McGee\ufffds case.  If the exact same case arose again, then stare decisis  would support ruling the same way. But Poretto\ufffds case is not the same; the relation of the defendant to the state is quite different; the question in her case is whether the statute could be used to exercise jurisdiction  on the facts in Poretto\ufffds case.  That\ufffds a new question on which the Utah court will rule anew. The court will likely conclude that the statute authorizes jurisdiction over National Insurance, and that it would be constitutional to exercise jurisdiction. Certainly, the statute applies: Just as in McGee\ufffds case, it\ufffds a claim brought by a Utah beneficiary to collect on the policy. And here, constitutional constraints are likely satisfied as well. The claim arises out of purposeful activity initiated by the insurer in Utah, soliciting a policy from a Utah resident. Although that\ufffds a single contact (or, perhaps, a series of yearly contacts) it is a deliberate contact that should lead the insurer to anticipate a suit in Utah arising out of that contact.

            "Context": "Long-arm statutes and specific jurisdiction So, in most situations, if a court is to exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, doing so must be authorized by a statute. In a fair number of states, those statutes are modeled on the Uniform Interstate and International Procedure Act. 6  These statutes authorize the local courts to exercise jurisdiction based on particular types of contacts with the forum state. These contacts often include transacting business in the state, contracting to supply goods or services in the state, committing a tortious act in the state, owning property in the state, and others. If the defendant did one of these things in the state, and that conduct gives rise to a claim, the plaintiff is authorized to bring the claim in the courts of the state. These statutes, in other words, authorize the state\ufffds courts to exercise \ufffd\ufffdspecific\ufffd\ufffd in personam jurisdiction\ufffdthat is, jurisdiction over claims that arise out of the defendant\ufffds purposeful acts focused on the state. International Shoe  held that such jurisdiction, arising out of acts focused on the state, is constitutional.

This seems straightforward, but it can throw students (and lawyers) off. Consider this example.",

Most of its customers are in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but it has a few in Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire as well.

D.  The Vermont court will have jurisdiction over Quantus if the Connecticut system is the same type of system that Quantus installed in Vermont.",
            "Analysis": "This isn\ufffdt a tough question, especially after the introductory discussion, but I would catch some students with it on an exam. The key to it is that long-arm statutes like this one authorize specific in personam jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over claims that arise out of  the in-state contact.  International Shoe  holds that a court may exercise jurisdiction over a defendant who does limited acts in the state, but only for claims that arise out of that activity. State legislatures have crafted their long-arm statutes accordingly, to authorize jurisdiction based on limited contacts only if the plaintiff\ufffds claim arises from those contacts. Too often, students lose sight of the requirement in the long- arm statute itself that the claim arise out of the defendant\ufffds in-state contacts. Both  A  and  B  reflect this oversight. Quantus did transact business in Vermont\ufffdit sold two computer systems there. It even sold one of them to Tawney & Hughes. It did contract to supply services in Vermont as well. However, Tawney & Hughes\ufffds claim does not arise out of Quantus\ufffds transaction of business or supplying services in Vermont; it arises from the sale of a system in Connecticut. The long-arm statute limits the Vermont court\ufffds authority to hear claims to those that  arise out of  the defendant\ufffds Vermont contacts, and the claim here doesn\ufffdt. There\ufffds a simple reason why the statute includes this limitation: Otherwise, the statute would authorize a great deal of jurisdiction that was beyond constitutional bounds. Here, for example, if the Vermont court exercised jurisdiction over Tawney & Hughes\ufffds claim for the Connecticut work, it would essentially be basing jurisdiction over Quantus on unrelated Vermont contacts. That is, it would be exercising general  in personam jurisdiction over Quantus. Two sales in Vermont is a clearly insufficient basis on which to assert general in personam jurisdiction. Thus, the arising-out-of limitation in the statute prevents it from authorizing jurisdiction over many cases that it could not hear under due process constraints. How about  D ? This is a distracting but inadequate distractor. The minimum contacts test requires that the claim arise out of the contacts the defendant made in the forum state, not contacts  like the ones it made in the forum state . Suppose that Acme, a chain saw manufacturer, sells its saws in Michigan, Minnesota, Illinois, and Iowa. It sells one to Wentworth in Iowa that is defective and causes an injury to Wentworth. Wentworth cannot sue Acme in Michigan simply because it does business there similar to its Iowa contacts. The logic of the minimum contacts test is that an out-of-state actor is subject to personal jurisdiction in the state for the contacts it chose to make in that state, but not based on others that it made in other states. The long-arm statute confirms this: It requires that the plaintiff\ufffds claim \ufffd\ufffdarise out of\ufffd\ufffd the in-state transacting, etc., and this one does not.

American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.,  176 N.E.2d 761 (Ill. 1961), as an example of a court grappling with a long-arm statute. In  Gray,  the defendant Titan Valve Company made a water heater valve in Ohio and sold it to American Radiator in Pennsylvania. American Radiator incorporated the valve into a water heater that was sold through the \ufffd\ufffdstream of commerce\ufffd\ufffd into Illinois. Later, the heater exploded in Mrs. Gray\ufffds Illinois home, injuring her. The Illinois long-arm statute authorized jurisdiction if the defendant \ufffd\ufffdcommits a tortious act within this state.\ufffd\ufffd The  Gray  court held that Titan had \ufffd\ufffdcommitted a tortious act\ufffd\ufffd in Illinois, because the valve had caused  an injury  in Illinois, and an act does not become a \ufffd\ufffdtortious act\ufffd\ufffd until the plaintiff suffers injury. Thus, Titan was subject to suit in Illinois under this long-arm provision, although it had not actually done any act in Illinois. This is a mighty broad interpretation of the commits-a-tortious-act phrase. The New York Court of Appeals rejected this extravagant interpretation shortly after the  Gray  decision.

But, of course, the question still remains whether, assuming a case falls within a long-arm statute that has been broadly construed by the state\ufffds courts, it would be constitutional to apply that statute in a particular case.

Let\ufffds see how the analysis works out in a state with a long-arm statute as broad as Illinois\ufffds. Hopefully,  C  did not catch much interest. It implies that, if the state\ufffds long-arm statute applies, jurisdiction is proper. However, that isn\ufffdt enough to support jurisdiction. Even if a long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction (and broad long-arm statutes make good politics, since they favor residents), the court still must ask whether it would exceed constitutional limits to apply the statute, given the defendant\ufffds contacts with the state.  C  would only be right if we repealed the Due Process Clause, which imposes constitutional limits on the assertion of jurisdiction over an out-of-stater. A  isn\ufffdt right either. Common sense may tell us that Jackson committed its tortious act in Florida, not Illinois. But the Illinois Supreme Court is the last word on the meaning of Illinois statutes, and it has construed its statute to mean that an actor commits a tortious act in Illinois if she commits the act elsewhere but the resulting injury takes place in Illinois. See  Gray v. American Radiator.  That may seem like a stretch, but that\ufffds how Illinois reads its statute.

It hasn\ufffdt changed the substance of this provision in the sixty-odd years since  Gray  was decided. So that leaves  B  and  D . Both affirm that the statute authorizes jurisdiction, but differ on whether it would be constitutional for the court to exercise jurisdiction over Jackson. B has the better of the argument: World-Wide Volkswagen  holds that it is unconstitutional for a state to exercise jurisdiction based solely on the fact that the plaintiff took the product to another state and was injured using it there. Jackson, like Seaway in  World-Wide,  has not purposely availed itself of the opportunity to conduct activities in Illinois; it just sells cars in Florida. To exercise jurisdiction over it on these facts would indeed make the chattel [the Audi] its \ufffd\ufffdagent for service of process,\ufffd\ufffd that is, it would allow suit wherever Robertson chooses to take the car and has an accident.

            "Context": "Another confuser: Constitutional and statutory limits on personal jurisdiction in the federal courts Most of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a  state  court\ufffds exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it\ufffds important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\ufffds power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\ufffds Due Process Clause, which provides, \ufffd\ufffdnor shall any  State  deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\ufffd\ufffd (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O\ufffdBrien Law Firm , 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice & Procedure  \ufffd1068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States. 7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support \ufffd\ufffdnationwide jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule. 8  In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): \ufffd\ufffdService of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won\ufffdt be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception. In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable \ufffd\ufffdlong-arm statute\ufffd\ufffd for the federal courts. Here\ufffds a question to illustrate the point.",
            "Question": "6. Dueling amendments.  Argo, from Arizona, sues Jason, from New Mexico, in an Arizona state court on a breach-of-contract claim, arising from Jason\ufffds alleged failure to complete a landscaping job in New Mexico. Jason removes the action to federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Jason then moves to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The federal court should deny the motion if the courts of Arizona would have personal jurisdiction over Jason under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Arizona long-arm statute. B.  The federal court should deny the motion if the Arizona long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment for the federal court to require Jason to defend the suit in Arizona. C.  The federal court should deny the motion if exercising jurisdiction over Jason would be constitutional under Fourteenth Amendment analysis. D.  The federal court should deny the motion, because a federal court has the constitutional power to hear claims against a defendant who has contacts anywhere in the United States. E.  The federal court should deny the motion, because Jason waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by removing to federal court.",
            "Analysis": "Rule 4(k)(1)(A) applies to cases removed to federal court as well as to cases filed there originally. Generally, under that rule, the court may exercise jurisdiction if the courts of the state in which the federal court sits could do so. As was pointed out in the removal chapter (see pp. 64-66), removing a case to federal court does  not  waive the right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be raised. Jason may remove and then move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Arizona federal court will then determine whether it has statutory and constitutional authority to exercise jurisdiction over him. So  E  here is a nonstarter. Choice  C  is tempting but incorrect. Under Federal Rule 4(k)(1)(A) the court indeed will ask whether it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise jurisdiction over Jason. But it will also  ask whether Arizona\ufffds long-arm statute has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction in the circumstances of Argo\ufffds case. So this choice is incomplete. D  is a nonstarter as well. It takes the broad position that, because the federal court could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction based on minimum contacts  anywhere  in the United States, the court has jurisdiction here. But, not to beat a dead myrmidon, 9  the fact that the federal court has constitutional power to exercise personal jurisdiction over Jason is only one step of the analysis. Jurisdiction must also be authorized by statute (or, in this case, by a Rule promulgated pursuant to statutory authority). We still have to look at Rule 4(k)(1)(A) to determine whether the federal court has been authorized to hear the case. Here, the statute (Rule, actually) says that the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over Jason if the state court could. What determines if the state court could? The Arizona long-arm statute and the  Fourteenth Amendment (not the Fifth). The federal judge has to ask herself, \ufffd\ufffdIf I were sitting in the Arizona state court, could I force Jason to come in and defend this action here?\ufffd\ufffd The answer to that depends on whether an Arizona statute authorizes jurisdiction over Jason and whether it would be consistent with due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise it. Those are the two constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction by an Arizona court. Rule 4(k)(1)(A) makes those same two constraints applicable in an Arizona federal court. Consequently,  A , not  B , is right.",

Consequently,  A  just can\ufffdt be right. If the court, by pronouncing that lofty \ufffd\ufffdlimits of due process\ufffd\ufffd language, could eliminate the requirement that the defendant do the act in the state, it would be substituting a California-type statute for the one the Acadia legislature wrote. The Acadia legislature didn\ufffdt want its courts to hear all the cases it constitutionally could. It deliberately wrote a statute that did not authorize certain cases to be heard in its courts, even if it would be constitutional for the court to hear them. Surely, the courts can\ufffdt construe away that limitation under the guise of broad statutory construction. The logic of  B  appears to be that, since the court has held that its statute reaches to the limits of due process, the court will have to interpret the statute to apply. So, it will have to hold that Margules was physically present in the state when he uttered the defamatory statements!

No, the Acadia courts may interpret their long-arm statutes expansively, but they won\ufffdt rewrite them to exercise constitutionally permissible jurisdiction that the legislature obviously did not grant.

Sunday River resells a substantial quantity of Ausable motors into Tennessee each year. Twelve of them are sold to Delta Retooling, a company in Nashville, Tennessee. While Lemmon is using an Ausable motor at Delta\ufffds Nashville shop, a belt flies off the flywheel and injures his eye. He sues Ausable in Tennessee.

B.  The case will likely be dismissed for failure to satisfy the long-arm statute. C.  The case will likely be dismissed because it would be unconstitutional to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ausable in this case.",
            "Analysis": "C  here is very likely wrong. It would probably be constitutionally permissible to sue Ausable in Tennessee in this case. True, it\ufffds a stream-of-commerce case, like  Asahi  and  J. McIntyre,  but here Ausable has  required  their buyer to resell in Tennessee. This deliberate effort to serve the Tennessee market would satisfy Justice O\ufffdConnor\ufffds understanding of purposeful availment. See 480 U.S. at 112 (marketing through a distributor in the state is one example of deliberate efforts to serve the market). And Justices Kennedy (who wrote the plurality opinion in  J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro ) and Breyer (who concurred in  J. McIntyre ) would almost certainly distinguish this case from  J. McIntyre  on the ground that Ausable has deliberately targeted the market for its products in Tennessee by requiring its distributor to resell in that state. That leaves us to consider whether the \ufffd\ufffdtransacting business\ufffd\ufffd provision of Tennessee\ufffds long-arm statute is satisfied here. \ufffd\ufffdTransacting business\ufffd\ufffd is hardly a self-defining concept. Ausable has not sold its motors directly in Tennessee. A court that construes this language narrowly might conclude that the legislature meant only to reach defendants who sold goods directly in the state. But that\ufffds not the only possible interpretation. Ausable has made active efforts to serve the market for its motors in Tennessee, by requiring Sunday River to solicit sales there. This conduct would suffice under a broad interpretation of the term \ufffd\ufffdtransacting business.\ufffd\ufffd See, e.g.,  Stabiliserungsfonds fur Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distrib., Inc.,  647 F.2d 200 (D.C. 1981) (interpreting \ufffd\ufffdtransacting business\ufffd\ufffd statute to authorize jurisdiction over foreign seller that sold in the forum through distributor);  Quality Air Services, L.L.C. v. Milwaukee Valve Co., Inc. , 567 F. Supp. 2d 96, 101 (D.D.C. 2008) (accord). And, because the Tennessee courts interpret their long-arm statute to go to the limits of due process, it will interpret the statute as broadly as it can without exceeding constitutional bounds. Here, such a broad interpretation would be within the constitutional bounds, as discussed immediately above. So the Tennessee court, which interprets the provisions of its jurisdictional statutes as broadly as constitutionally permissible, would conclude that Ausable had \ufffd\ufffdtransacted business\ufffd\ufffd in Tennessee. That, I think, is what it means to interpret a long-arm statute to \ufffd\ufffdgo to the limits of due process\ufffd\ufffd: to choose, where the statute might be interpreted narrowly or broadly, the broadest interpretation that is consistent with constitutional limits.

            "Context": "The special appearance and the motion to dismiss The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\ufffds been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\ufffdd feel the same way. \ufffd\ufffdHey, wait! This case doesn\ufffdt belong here; throw it out.\ufffd\ufffd All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\ufffds exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \ufffd\ufffdspecial appearance.\ufffd\ufffd The defendant would \ufffd\ufffdappear specially\ufffd\ufffd for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before  Pennoyer,  courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\ufffds authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \ufffd\ufffdappeared generally,\ufffd\ufffd waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\ufffds power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g.,  Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada,  629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\ufffds motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \ufffd\ufffdspecial appearance\ufffd\ufffd had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising  all of her defenses on the merits,  and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\ufffds a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\ufffds  first response  to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in  Chapter 18  on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\ufffdt right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\ufffdvery carefully\ufffdenter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\ufffds a question to test the point. I\ufffdve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\ufffdve read the discussion above it should be easy.",
            "Question": "1. Something special.  Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\ufffds attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would",
            "Options": "Options: A.  hear and decide the jurisdictional objection, since Ito has properly raised the objection by making a special appearance. B.  conclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue. C.  consider both objections, since it would apply the Massachusetts approach to raising jurisdictional objections. D.  conclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him.",
            "Analysis": "By the way, here\ufffds a quick point on exam-taking strategy, which I may already have made but is worth repeating. The question asks you to assume that Nevada follows the special appearance approach. Suppose that you happen to know that Nevada  doesn\ufffdt  follow that approach anymore? What would you do in answering the question? Remember that the professor is the boss in writing her exam. If she asks you to assume that under Nevada law the court orders the immediate execution in the public square of a defendant who objects to jurisdiction, you should answer the question on that assumption. I wouldn\ufffdt recommend answering on the basis of personal knowledge that Nevada actually uses a different rule. This isn\ufffdt the real world, it\ufffds a constructed hypothetical and should be answered on its own terms. The real loser here is  C . The Nevada court will, of course, apply its own rules concerning the procedure for raising jurisdictional objections in a Nevada law suit. And, the question indicates, its rule is that a defendant waives her objection to personal jurisdiction, even if she comes into court and raises it, if she also raises other arguments. That is just what Ito did here; he objected to jurisdiction, but then raised a defense on the merits as well. True, he raised the objection to personal jurisdiction first, but under (the assumed) Nevada law any response that appears to litigate the substantive issues in the case waives the special appearance and consents to the jurisdiction of the court. So  A  isn\ufffdt quite right; although Ito properly made a special appearance, his later motion raising the limitations issue waives his objection to jurisdiction. Ito should have waited to make his second motion until the personal jurisdiction issue was resolved. D  is interesting. Might the court agree that Ito had made a procedural misstep, but still consider the jurisdictional issue, if it appears that the court lacks a basis for requiring Ito to defend in Nevada? Almost certainly not. The point of the special appearance rule is that an appearance that contests any issue other than jurisdiction is a consent to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel\ufffds in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court\ufffds subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived. The very point of the special appearance rule is that the defendant waives it by combining it with other objections. Consequently, the court need not consider whether there is some other basis for exercising jurisdiction over Ito.  B  is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\ufffds lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\ufffdt. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do.",

            "Context": "So, the defendant, if he does it right, can come into the court where the case is filed and object to jurisdiction. Ito, for example, if he navigates the special appearance rules carefully, could raise his objection in the Nevada court and have the judge decide it before considering the merits of the case. Suppose that he does, and the court rules that it has jurisdiction over him. What should Ito do next? If the court holds that Ito is subject to jurisdiction, it will naturally proceed to litigate the claim. If Ito stalks off in a huff and refuses to participate\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddefaults,\ufffd\ufffd in the language of civil procedure\ufffdthe court will enter a default judgment for the plaintiff, which will very likely be enforceable in that state or in others. (More on that later.) You wouldn\ufffdt advise Ito to do that. Instead, you might suggest that he take an immediate appeal of the judge\ufffds finding that he is subject to jurisdiction there. If he could get the Nevada appellate court to reverse the trial judge\ufffds ruling, and order the case dismissed, he would at least avoid litigating the merits of the underlying claim in Nevada. Thinking of a law suit as a time line, Ito would rather obtain review of the jurisdictional finding at Point  A  rather than having to litigate the case on the merits and then appeal (if he loses on the merits) at the much later Point  B . If he can\ufffdt take an immediate appeal, he will end up doing exactly what he believes he shouldn\ufffdt have to: litigating in the Nevada court. In many cases, this could take several years, and involve expensive discovery and a full trial on the merits. Some states do allow a defendant to immediately appeal the trial court\ufffds decision that it has personal jurisdiction over the defendant. But other states, and the federal courts, take the view that this decision is \ufffd\ufffdinterlocutory\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdpart of an ongoing process in the trial court\ufffdthat cannot be reviewed until the case is litigated to a final judgment in the trial court. See, e.g.,  IHT Corp. v. Paragon Cutlery Co.,  794 A.2d 651, 653 (Me. 2002). There\ufffds a good argument for this no-interlocutory- appeal approach. A trial judge makes many decisions in the course of a case. One of the parties\ufffdthe one who loses on the issue\ufffdprobably objects to most of these. If the loser could appeal each such decision, the case would bounce back and forth between the trial and the appellate courts repeatedly, causing delay and expense to the parties. And remember that many of those decisions along the way will not end up being crucial to the outcome of the case. After all, most cases settle. And the party who loses on one issue may still win the case on another. For example, the court might hold that it has jurisdiction over Ito, but later accept his argument that the limitations period for the claim had passed. If so, he would have no reason to seek review of the jurisdictional decision. For a variety of reasons, many contested issues fall by the wayside before the case is resolved, so it may not be wise to allow immediate review. So, the answer here is that the answer varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some states, Ito could obtain immediate review of the trial judge\ufffds decision that he is subject to jurisdiction, without having to litigate the merits of the case in the trial court first. In others, and in the federal courts, he would have to litigate the case on the merits in the trial court and then appeal the jurisdictional finding if he loses on the merits. In these courts, however, he does not waive his objection by litigating the case in the trial court. (That would be a tough rule, wouldn\ufffdt it, since once the trial court finds that it has jurisdiction, Ito really has no choice but to stay and litigate the case.) If he loses the case on the merits, he may still appeal the jurisdiction question at Point  B , after the case reaches final judgment. Let\ufffds illustrate this with a thorny question.",
            "Question": "2. Appealing options.  Assume that Ervin brings his action for fraudulent misrepresentation against Ito in Emporia, a state that follows the Federal Rules approach to jurisdictional objections and does not allow interlocutory appeals of jurisdictional rulings. Ito, believing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him, answers Ervin\ufffds complaint, denying the allegations of fraud, raising a statute of limitations defense, and objecting to the court\ufffds exercise of personal jurisdiction over him for the claim. The court holds a hearing on Ito\ufffds jurisdictional objection, and rules that he is subject to jurisdiction for Ervin\ufffds claim. Consequently, it refuses to dismiss the case. Ito therefore defends the case on the merits. After trial, the jury concludes that his representations were fraudulent, that the suit was not barred by the statute of limitations, and awards damages to Ervin. Final judgment is entered for Ervin.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ito may not appeal the jurisdictional ruling. He waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising it in the answer with other defenses on the merits. B.  Ito may not appeal the jurisdictional ruling. He waived his objection by litigating the case on the merits. He should have defaulted, allowed a final default judgment to enter for Ervin, and appealed on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to render it. C.  Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for Ervin\ufffds claim, it will order the case dismissed. Ervin will have to bring a new action in a state that does have jurisdiction over Ito for the claim, and relitigate the case. D.  Ito may appeal the jurisdictional ruling. If the appellate court concludes that he was not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia, it will order the case dismissed. However, the parties will not relitigate the case. Ervin will sue Ito in a state that does have jurisdiction over him. That court will enter a judgment based on the findings by the jury in the Emporia suit.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds take the options in order.  A  is wrong, because Emporia follows the Federal Rules approach to jurisdictional objections. Under that approach, the defendant need not file a special appearance  or a pre-answer motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. She may choose to answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses and jurisdictional objections together. She does not waive the jurisdictional defense by asserting it in the answer along with defenses on the merits. B  is wrong too. It reflects the position that the defendant should either abandon her objection to jurisdiction, or stake her whole case on it, by defaulting on the merits, allowing a final judgment to enter, and hoping to convince the appellate court that the trial judge was wrong on jurisdiction. This would put the defendant in a very tough position. Most lawyers would advise their clients not to default, even if it meant abandoning their jurisdictional objection. Losing the chance to litigate the real case\ufffdwhether Ito committed fraud and injured Ervin\ufffdis too great a price to pay for the chance to appeal the objection to jurisdiction. But the courts don\ufffdt require the defendant to pay that price. After the trial judge refuses to dismiss, Ito may stay, defend the merits of the fraud allegations in the trial court, and (if he loses on the merits) appeal after final judgment, claiming that the court had no power to make him litigate in Emporia. So Ito may appeal, even though he stayed and litigated the fraud case after the judge decided that he was subject to jurisdiction in Emporia. But what will the appellate court do if it determines that the trial judge was wrong? It will have to dismiss the case. If Ito was not subject to jurisdiction, then the court below had no authority to hear the case. If the court had no power to proceed, its proceedings are invalid. The appellate court will order the case dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. So  C  is right; Ervin will have to start over from scratch (risking, of course, statute of limitations problems). The court in the new action will not fashion a judgment based on the findings in the Emporia suit (as  D suggests). To do so would be to treat them as valid findings. If the court had no authority to render them they are not valid, and cannot bind Ito in the new action.",

            "Context": "Challenging jurisdiction in the enforcing court. A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\ufffdt be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\ufffds state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \ufffd\ufffdjudgment on the judgment\ufffd\ufffd in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\ufffds judgment. An Acadia court would not order \ufffd\ufffdexecution\ufffd\ufffd on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\ufffds assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\ufffds the plaintiff, Ito\ufffds the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\ufffds judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\ufffds assets sold to satisfy his judgment. 1 However,  states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\ufffds position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before  Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff,  95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.",
            "Question": "3. Default positions.  Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Emporia uses the common law special appearance approach to challenging personal jurisdiction. Ito is served in Acadia with the complaint and summons in the action. On counsel\ufffds advice that he is not subject to jurisdiction in Emporia for this claim, Ito ignores the suit. After obtaining a default judgment in the Emporia action, Ervin brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito is served with the complaint and summons in this enforcement action in Acadia. He appears, and raises the defense that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin\ufffds claim. Consequently, Ito argues, the Emporia judgment is not entitled to full faith and credit.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  If the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, it will order judgment entered on the Emporia judgment. B.  If the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, it will order Ito to appear and defend the original action in the Emporia court. C.  The Acadia court will not consider whether the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, because Ito failed to make a special appearance to challenge jurisdiction in the Emporia court. D.  If the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over Ito, it will proceed to adjudicate the merits of Ervin\ufffds fraud claim.",
            "Analysis": "This question illustrates the consequences of the tactical decision to default in the original court (we\ufffdll call it the \ufffd\ufffdrendering court,\ufffd\ufffd since it renders the original judgment for Ervin) and resist enforcement in another state. The enforcing state\ufffdAcadia here\ufffdhas very few options in this scenario. It may hear evidence and argument on the issue of the rendering court\ufffds jurisdiction, and refuse to enter a judgment on the judgment if it concludes that the rendering court lacked the power to render it, that is, if it lacked personal jurisdiction over Ito. But if it concludes that the rendering court did have jurisdiction over Ito, the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires the Acadia court to enforce the judgment. It cannot reopen the merits, or simply refuse to help Ervin collect his judgment against a local resident. D  is again a dog. If the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the fraud claim, it will not proceed to adjudicate that claim itself. Ervin hasn\ufffdt asked the Acadia court to do that. His action seeks a judgment recognizing his Emporia judgment. If that judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, the Acadia court will award him an Acadia judgment recognizing the Emporia judgment, so that Ervin can use Acadia enforcement procedures to collect it. If that judgment is not entitled to full faith and credit, the Acadia court will refuse to enter a judgment on it. But the Acadia suit is not about the merits of the fraud claim; it\ufffds about the validity of the Emporia judgment. C  is highly seductive. It is true that, in Emporia, a defendant challenges the court\ufffds jurisdiction by filing a special appearance. Since Ito failed to do that, hasn\ufffdt he waived his objection to the Emporia court\ufffds jurisdiction? No. A defendant who  stays away entirely  does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction. He may still raise it \ufffd\ufffdcollaterally\ufffd\ufffd when Ervin obtains a default judgment in the rendering court and brings it to Acadia to enforce. That judgment is only entitled to full faith and credit in other states if the rendering court had the power to render it. And it only had that power if it had personal jurisdiction over the defendant. So here, Ito may challenge the validity of the judgment in the Acadia court by arguing that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. B  suggests that, if the Acadia court concludes that the Emporia court had jurisdiction, it will order Ito to appear in the Emporia court and defend the action on the merits. This won\ufffdt happen either. The Emporia suit is over. Final judgment has entered for Ervin. If the judgment is valid, the Acadia court must enforce it. If it isn\ufffdt, it won\ufffdt. But it cannot do what  B  suggests, tell Ito that he made a mistake, and give him the chance to undo it in the rendering court. If the Emporia court had jurisdiction over Ito, its judgment is valid, even though rendered by default, and Acadia must enforce it.  A  is the right answer. Imagine what would happen if  B  were right. Defendants sued in another state would simply default, and wait for the plaintiff to bring the judgment to their home state for enforcement. Then, they would object on jurisdictional grounds. If the court agrees, great; if it disagrees, they would simply have to appear belatedly in the rendering court to litigate the merits. That would be nice for defendants, but frustrating for plaintiffs and an intolerable waste for courts. So the question illustrates the great risk that the defendant takes by choosing to challenge jurisdiction collaterally, in the enforcing court, rather than directly in the rendering court. If her guess about personal jurisdiction turns out to be wrong, she will have lost her chance to defend the case on the merits. The default judgment will be valid, and the enforcing court will have no choice but to honor it.",

But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff,  95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.",
            "Question": "4. Late, or never?  Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Assume that Emporia uses the Federal Rules approach to challenging personal jurisdiction. Ito is served in Acadia with the complaint and summons in the action. He answers the complaint, denying that his representations were fraudulent and denying that they injured Ervin. The case is litigated, and ultimately tried to a jury, which finds for Ervin. The judge enters a judgment for $50,000 for Ervin. However, Ito has no assets in Emporia, and does not pay the judgment. Ervin now brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito appears and raises the defense that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin\ufffds claim.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The Acadia court may consider whether the Emporia court had jurisdiction over Ito, since Ito did not litigate the issue in the Emporia court. B.  The Acadia court may consider whether the Emporia court had jurisdiction over Ito. Under the Federal Rules approach, Ito could have raised the issue in the Emporia court, but didn\ufffdt have to. C.  The Acadia court may not consider whether the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito, because Ito waived his objection to jurisdiction in the Emporia court. D.  The Acadia court may consider whether the Emporia court had personal jurisdiction over Ito. Although Ito waived the issue in the Emporia court, he has not waived it in the Acadia court.",
            "Analysis": "In this example, Ito appeared and litigated the case on the merits in Emporia. He lost. Ervin then brings his judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito argues that it is not entitled to full faith and credit because the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction over him.  A  takes the position that this is all right, since Ito never litigated personal jurisdiction in Emporia. But consider what a waste it would be to allow the parties to litigate the entire case and reach a resolution, only to have it undermined in the enforcing court for lack of jurisdiction. If there\ufffds a problem with jurisdiction, it ought to be raised and decided in the rendering court before litigating the merits, not in the enforcing court  after  litigating the merits. This is why courts have such strict rules about raising objections to personal jurisdiction or losing them. Here, Ito answered the complaint and litigated the fraud claim without objecting to personal jurisdiction. When he did that, he  waived his objection  to personal jurisdiction. Under the Federal Rules approach, that objection may be raised in the answer to the complaint (if no pre-answer motion is filed) or in a motion to dismiss before answering. But if it isn\ufffdt raised at the outset by one of these responses, the objection is waived.  B  is wrong; the Federal Rules may be a bit more flexible about the methods for raising a jurisdictional objection, but they still require that the defendant raise it at the outset of the suit, or waive it by the failure to assert it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h). Once waived, the objection is lost. So  A  is wrong. Ito can lose his personal jurisdiction objection by  not  litigating it, as well as by litigating it. And once lost, it is lost not only in the Emporia court, but in any enforcing court as well. So  D  is wrong too. Once Ito waives the objection, it can\ufffdt be resuscitated to resist enforcement later in another state. If this were not so, Ito could litigate the merits in Emporia, and hold his objection to jurisdiction to litigate later in Acadia. This would prove extremely wasteful, should the Acadia court conclude that the Emporia court that rendered the judgment (after full litigation) lacked personal jurisdiction to do so. Better to force the objection out at the outset, in the rendering court, in this situation, by applying the principle that a failure to raise it constitutes a waiver of the objection.  C  rules the roost.",

            "Context": "Challenging jurisdiction in the enforcing court A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\ufffdt be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\ufffds state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \ufffd\ufffdjudgment on the judgment\ufffd\ufffd in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\ufffds judgment. An Acadia court would not order \ufffd\ufffdexecution\ufffd\ufffd on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\ufffds assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\ufffds the plaintiff, Ito\ufffds the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\ufffds judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\ufffds assets sold to satisfy his judgment. 1 However,  states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\ufffds position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before  Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered.

So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.

Ervin now brings suit in Acadia, seeking a judgment on the Emporia judgment. Ito is served with the complaint and summons in the action in Acadia. He appears, and argues that the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him, and that he never made false representations to Ervin about the stock.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Ito may raise both defenses in the Acadia enforcement action, since he did not litigate them in the Emporia court. B.  Ito may raise both defenses in the Acadia enforcement action, but the court will only hear the substantive defense to the fraud claim if it determines that the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction over Ito. C.  Ito may not raise either defense in the Acadia enforcement action, because he waived them by defaulting in the Emporia action. D.  Ito may raise the personal jurisdiction defense in the Acadia enforcement action, but not the substantive defense to the fraud claim.",
            "Analysis": "This is more a recap than anything else. Here, Ito defaulted in the original action, and now raises jurisdictional and substantive defenses in the enforcing court. He may assert the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, because the judgment isn\ufffdt valid if the Emporia court lacked jurisdiction over him. And he hasn\ufffdt waived that defense, because he never appeared in the Emporia action. So he\ufffds preserved his right to object in the enforcing court based on lack of jurisdiction. But he won\ufffdt be able to litigate the merits of the fraud claim in the Acadia enforcement action. Thus,  A  and  B  are wrong, because the only issue Ito can litigate in the Acadia action is whether the Emporia judgment is valid. If Ito wanted to raise the defense that his statements were not fraudulent, there was only one place to do it: in the original action. His default there waives all defenses in the action, other than jurisdictional ones. 2  So  D  is the best answer; Ito may resist enforcement based on lack of jurisdiction in the rendering court, but not based on any defense to the underlying fraud claim. It\ufffds still possible, however, that he will get a chance to defend the claim on the merits. If the Acadia court determines that there was no jurisdiction to render the original judgment, and refuses to enforce it, Ervin will likely bring a new action\ufffdprobably in Acadia, since Ito\ufffds assets are there. Ervin would be able to bring a new suit on the merits, because the first one, in which the court lacked jurisdiction, is viewed as a nullity. Ervin can\ufffdt enforce it, and Ito isn\ufffdt bound by his default in that suit. It has no legal effect. Ervin will have to start over, if the limitations period hasn\ufffdt passed and he can find a court that does have jurisdiction over Ito. If he does, Ito will presumably appear and answer the fraud allegations, and the parties will end up litigating the merits of the claim in this later action.",

None of the above is true.",
            "Analysis": "Although the introduction doesn\ufffdt give you the black letter on this, you must have had an uncomfortable feeling that this tactic wasn\ufffdt going to work for Ito. It shouldn\ufffdt, should it? He already had his \ufffd\ufffdbite at the apple\ufffd\ufffd on personal jurisdiction. He litigated the issue in the Emporia court and lost on it. This looks like sour grapes, or an effort to try again in a forum that may be more favorably disposed towards a local resident. A  has a slight patina of credibility. We saw earlier that a party who litigated and lost on jurisdiction has a right to appeal that issue and try to get it reversed. But that right allows Ito to appeal the Emporia trial judge\ufffds ruling to an  Emporia  appellate court, not save it up and appeal it in the enforcing court. If a judge in an Emporia court makes an incorrect finding, the Emporia court system is the one to correct it; the Acadia appellate courts have no authority to review rulings of the Emporia trial courts. (Imagine what a mess it would be if New York appellate judges started reviewing the rulings of California trial judges.

While it is generally true that a defendant may challenge jurisdiction \ufffd\ufffdcollaterally\ufffd\ufffd in the enforcing court, she may not do so if she appeared and litigated the issue in the original action, as Ito did in this example. Civil procedure has a vexing doctrine called \ufffd\ufffdcollateral estoppel\ufffd\ufffd that bars parties from relitigating issues that were litigated and resolved between them in a prior proceeding. See  Chapter 25  for some vexing analysis of this vexing doctrine.  B  is right; since Ito appeared and litigated whether the Emporia court had jurisdiction over him in the Emporia action, the Acadia court will estop him from litigating that issue again when Ervin sues to enforce the judgment. Once is enough; if Ito really wants to litigate the jurisdiction issue in an Acadia court, he\ufffds going to have to default in Emporia\ufffda huge price to pay\ufffdto preserve his right to do so.",

            "Context": "Constitutional standards for adequate notice: Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. When a court enters a civil judgment against a person, it begins the process of taking the person\ufffds property (usually in the form of money). Consequently, the due process clause requires the court to use a fair procedure in entering judgment. Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to  tell the defendant  that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called \ufffd\ufffdpersonal service of process.\ufffd\ufffd Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant\ufffds home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as \ufffd\ufffdconstructive service,\ufffd\ufffd as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson\ufffds wise opinion in  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. , 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane  involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property\ufffdthe right to sue the bank for mismanagement\ufffddue process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in  Mullane  was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane  held that \ufffd\ufffdan elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\ufffd\ufffd 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of  Mullane , several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in  Mullane  did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. The question below probes what it did  require.",
            "Question": "1. Unnoticed notice.  In  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. , the Supreme Court held that",
            "Options": "Options: A.  every person whose interests may be affected by a judicial proceeding is entitled to at least mail notice of the proceeding. B.  every person whose name and address could be ascertained through reasonable investigation must be given individual notice of the proceeding. C.  any person whose interests might be affected by the proceeding must be given notice by in-hand service of process. D.  due to the large number of persons whose interests might be affected by the proceedings, notice by publication was sufficient on the facts of the case. E.  None of the above is true.",
            "Analysis": "A  takes the position that everyone who might be affected by the settlement of the accounts must receive individual notice. If that were true, it would be impossible to settle the accounts of the trust. Even some beneficiaries with a current right to income may be impossible to find; if due process required individual notice to them it couldn\ufffdt be done. Other people have contingent interests: They might get income in the future, for example, as the heir of a current beneficiary. The bank may not know who these contingent beneficiaries are, though it might be able, with research, to find some of them. Justice Jackson viewed due process as a flexible concept that involves a balance of the importance of the right involved, the risk of an erroneous decision, the cost of providing individual notice, and the likelihood that the absentee\ufffds interest would be protected by other parties. He rejected the view that everyone with some interest in the action must be individually notified for it to proceed. B  would impose a lesser burden: to notify the persons whose interests could be ascertained with reasonable investigation. This could be done, but it would be costly, involving legal review of 113 trusts and factual research on the whereabouts of all identified beneficiaries. This would more effectively reach affected persons, but the cost of doing so would likely impose such a severe burden on the plan as to \ufffd\ufffddissipate its advantages.\ufffd\ufffd 339 U.S. at 318. Under the circumstances\ufffdincluding the presence of the guardian appointed to represent the interests of beneficiaries and the actual notice to many of them\ufffdthe Court held that due process did not require that. Consequently, a beneficiary might never learn of the proceeding, have her right to object to the accounts foreclosed by it, and have no constitutional complaint. C  is also a loser.  Mullane  held that notice by mail is sufficiently likely to actually inform a person of the proceeding to be constitutionally sufficient under most circumstances. In fact,  Mullane  did not hold that anyone had to be notified of the suit by personal service of process\ufffdthat is, by in-hand delivery of the papers. And  D  fails as well. The Court required at least mail notice of the action to those beneficiaries whose names and addresses were known to the bank, since they could easily and inexpensively be informed of the action. So  E  is right. None of the prior statements is quite true.",

This eliminates options that mandate specific methods (A, B, C) as Mullane emphasizes a flexible standard based on circumstances.\n\nStep 2: Option D states that publication notice was sufficient in Mullane. While the Court did allow for publication in that case, it wasn't because of a general preference for publication but due to the specific circumstances: difficulty in identifying all beneficiaries, the appointment of a guardian, and the likelihood of many beneficiaries receiving notice and representing others {QC 3}.  Therefore, Option D is not a general holding of Mullane, but a fact-specific application of the \"reasonably calculated\" standard.\n\nStep 3: Options A, B, and C propose absolute requirements for notice (mail, reasonable investigation, in-hand service), which directly contradicts Mullane's flexible, circumstance-based approach {QC 1}.  Mullane does not establish any of these as universally necessary.\n\nStep 4: Because Mullane establishes a flexible standard of \"reasonably calculated\" notice {QC 1}, and none of the options accurately reflect this nuanced holding {QC 2, QC 3}, the correct answer is E.

Certainly, one component of a fair procedure is to  tell the defendant  that the court is going to adjudicate her rights. Hence, the Due Process Clause requires a court to use a constitutionally adequate means of notifying the defendant that a lawsuit has been commenced against her. Typically, it is the plaintiff who does the legwork of serving process on the defendant. The statutes or court rules in every state contain detailed provisions governing how this notice of a lawsuit is provided to the defendant. Court rules may authorize various means of serving process. The most obvious is to deliver the initiating papers in the case to the defendant in person, called \ufffd\ufffdpersonal service of process.\ufffd\ufffd Other methods are often authorized as well, though they are less certain to actually inform the defendant about the suit. The service rules may provide, for example, that the papers may be left with someone at the defendant\ufffds home or place of business or slipped under the door. Some authorize service to the defendant by certified or ordinary mail. In some circumstances, court rules or statutes may authorize service by publication, by printing a notice of the suit in the legal notices in the local newspaper for several weeks. Such publication notice is sometimes referred to as \ufffd\ufffdconstructive service,\ufffd\ufffd as opposed to actual delivery of the papers to the defendant. Which of these methods is constitutionally adequate under the Due Process Clause? Justice Jackson\ufffds wise opinion in  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. , 339 U.S. 306 (1950) does not provide a mechanical answer to that question, but instead establishes broad standards for constitutionally adequate notice. Mullane  involved a device called a common trust fund, which allowed a bank to pool a group of small trusts into one common fund, which could be managed more efficiently. Income (or losses) from the trust would then be shared by each smaller trust in proportion to their contributions to the fund. Periodically, the trustee of the fund would file accounts with the court. If the court approved the accounts, its judgment would bar investors from suing the bank for mismanagement. Since this judicial accounting could deprive trust beneficiaries of property\ufffdthe right to sue the bank for mismanagement\ufffddue process required adequate notice to them of the proceeding. The problem in  Mullane  was that it was difficult to ascertain who all the beneficiaries were. Beneficiaries currently entitled to receive income from the trust were known, and the bank had their addresses in its files. But most trusts have contingent beneficiaries, such as the children or heirs of a beneficiary if the primary beneficiary dies. The bank might not know who these beneficiaries were, and they could change periodically. Perhaps, with a large investment of time by lawyers and investigators, the bank could identify most them, but doing so would eat up the profits of the common trust fund. Many were contingent beneficiaries; that is, they had no current right to receive income from the fund but might become vested beneficiaries later under the terms of the individual trusts. So who did the bank have to tell about the suit and how? Mullane  held that \ufffd\ufffdan elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\ufffd\ufffd 339 U.S. at 314. What is reasonable in one circumstance would not necessarily satisfy due process in another. On the facts of  Mullane , several factors reduced the risk of error if notice failed to reach all beneficiaries. First, the statute provided for the appointment of a guardian in the settlement proceeding to represent the interests of all beneficiaries. Second, even if all beneficiaries did not receive notice of the proceeding, many would, and would likely share and represent the interests of all beneficiaries in the settlement of the accounts. Consequently, the Court in  Mullane  did not require that each individual with an interest in the fund be given personal notice of the action. With Mullane\ufffds constitutional standards in mind, consider the following enigma.",
            "Question": "2. Mailing it in.  LeCompte brings suit against Wilkins for battery in state court. His counsel looks up the state\ufffds Civil Procedure Rule for service of process and finds that the rule authorizes service of process by first class mail. He serves the complaint and summons on Wilkins by mailing them, first class, to Wilkins at his home address. If Wilkins raises the objection that service of process was improper, the court will likely",
            "Options": "Options: A.  reject the argument, because LeCompte used a form of service that was authorized by the state\ufffds service of process rules. B.  uphold his objection, because service by first class mail is not constitutionally proper. C.  uphold his objection if LeCompte could have arranged for in-hand service on Wilkins. D.  reject the argument, because service of process by first class mail is constitutionally sufficient.",
            "Analysis": "A  is a great wrong answer, and it is important to recognize why it is wrong. As a lawyer, it is always comforting to argue that you followed the rules, and LeCompte has followed the rule here, which authorized service by mail. But states can\ufffdt write any rules they want: Their rules for service of process must meet constitutional standards. After all, the bank followed the state service statute in  Mullane , but the Supreme Court held that, as to some beneficiaries, its method of service was inadequate. So it is never a complete answer that the rule authorizes the method used. B  reflects the position that service of process by first class mail is constitutionally insufficient under  Mullane . In almost all cases, however, service by first class mail will be upheld under  Mullane , which described the mails as \ufffd\ufffdan efficient and inexpensive means of communication.\ufffd\ufffd 339 U.S. at 319. Indeed,  Mullane  required notice by mail to persons with interests in the trusts whose addresses were within the bank\ufffds files. Mail service will almost certainly be upheld. And, if it is constitutionally sufficient, and authorized (as it is here) by the state service rule, it will be upheld, even if LeCompte could have done something even better, such as in-hand service. So  C  also fails. Choose  D .",

This is not guaranteed, as first-class mail may not reach the intended recipient. {QC 2}\n\nStep 4: The fact that the state rules authorize this method {QC 3} does not automatically make it constitutionally sufficient.

            "Context": "The separate requirements of notice and personal jurisdiction. Because Pennoyer based jurisdiction on service of process, it tended to\nblur the distinction between two constitutional requirements\ufffdadequate notice to the defendant and a basis to adjudicate. But these are separate requirements, each of which must be met. Personal jurisdiction requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state that makes it fair to require her to defend the action there. The distinct constitutional requirement of notice of the action assures that the defendant is adequately informed that a court is going to adjudicate a claim involving\nher rights. As Mullane mandates, every court system requires careful procedures to inform the defendant of the commencement of a lawsuit. This constitutional requirement is satisfied if the initial papers in the action are served on the defendant by a means reasonably calculated to actually inform her of the pendency of the action. Pennoyer v. Neff creates confusion about these requirements for three reasons. First, under Pennoyer, the same act\ufffdpersonal service of the papers in the action on the defendant\ufffdprovided both notice of the action and a basis for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction. Notice was sufficient under the Pennoyer regime, because handing the papers to the defendant in person is more likely than any other method to actually inform her that she has been sued. And the court acquired jurisdiction, under Pennoyer\ufffds reasoning, if service was made while the defendant was in the forum state, because the court had authority over persons and property \ufffd\ufffdseized\ufffd\ufffd within the forum state. Second, the Pennoyer opinion suggests that giving the defendant notice by publication, that is, publishing notice of the commencement of an action in a newspaper, satisfies the constitutional due process requirement to give notice of the action, at least in cases commenced by attachment. This is no longer good law. Under Mullane, publication is not sufficient to \ufffd\ufffdreasonably inform [the defendant] of the pendency of the action\ufffd\ufffd (Mullane, 339 U.S. at 315) unless no other type of notice more likely to reach her is possible. See Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams, 462 U.S. 791, 796 (1983). Generally, there are better alternatives, such as personal service or delivery through some form of mail to the defendant\ufffds last known address. In cases against corporations, service on an officer or managing agent of the corporation will provide adequate notice to the corporation that suit has been filed against it. A third source of confusion arises from Pennoyer\ufffds suggestion that service of process outside the state was always improper. \ufffd\ufffdProcess from the tribunals of one State cannot run into another State, and summon parties there domiciled to leave its territory and respond to proceedings against them [in another state].\ufffd\ufffd 95 U.S. at 727. However, this language from Pennoyer means that such service in another state would not provide a basis for jurisdiction. It did not mean that serving the papers on the defendant in another state would not constitute adequate notice that the law suit had been filed. Today, courts commonly exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants located in other states, based on minimum contacts in the state where the suit is brought. In such cases, personal delivery of the papers notifying the defendant of the action, or some form of mail notice, provides constitutionally adequate notice of the action, even though delivered outside the forum state (the state in which the action is brought).\nThis example may help to sort out these two constitutional touchstones.",
            "Question": "4. Served, but not satisfied. Carnahan, from New Hampshire, has an accident with Perkins, from Missouri, in New York. After the accident, they exchange papers and leave. Carnahan decides to sue Perkins for his injuries. In which of the following cases are constitutional standards for both notice and personal jurisdiction likely to be satisfied? Assume that current standards for personal jurisdiction apply.",
            "Options": "Options: A. Carnahan sues Perkins in New Hampshire, for the accident. He sends a process server to Perkins\ufffds house in Missouri to serve him with the summons and complaint. Perkins answers the door and the process server delivers the papers to Perkins, with an explanation of the lawsuit and the process for responding to it.\nB. Carnahan sues Perkins in New York for the New York accident. He publishes notice of the action four weeks in a row in the New York Times.\nC. Carnahan sues Perkins in New York for the New York accident. Carnahan serves the summons and complaint on Perkins by mailing them, certified mail, return receipt requested, to Perkins at his home in Missouri.\nD. Carnahan sues Ace Tool & Die Company, Perkins\ufffds Missouri employer, for the New York accident, since it occurred while Perkins was making a delivery for Ace. He sues in a New Hampshire state court. He delivers the summons and complaint to Walker, president of Ace Tool & Die, while she is at a convention in Manchester, New Hampshire.",
            "Analysis": "In A, Carnahan\ufffds method of service of process is constitutionally sufficient. Carnahan has delivered the papers directly to Perkins, with an explanation of what they are and what he must do to respond. Notice doesn\ufffdt get any better than this. Perkins can hardly argue that Carnahan has failed to give notice by a means reasonably calculated to actually inform him of the law suit. However, there is no basis for the New Hampshire court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Perkins. He doesn\ufffdt live in New Hampshire. The action doesn\ufffdt arise out of New Hampshire contacts. Nor was he served with process in New Hampshire. The facts don\ufffdt suggest any basis for the New Hampshire court to exercise personal jurisdiction over Perkins for this claim. Constitutionally adequate notice is necessary, but not sufficient to allow the New Hampshire court to proceed. The court must also have a basis for requiring Perkins to defend in New Hampshire before it can proceed. In B, the claim arises out of conduct by Perkins\ufffddriving in the state where the suit is brought. It is certainly foreseeable that driving in a state may give rise to injury and that the injured party would sue where the accident took place. Under International Shoe, this is a contact that gives rise to specific in personam jurisdiction over Perkins. But notice by publication in the Times is not likely to be found constitutionally sufficient. Publication is generally viewed as a last resort, permissible only where no means of notice more likely to actually reach the defendant is feasible. As long as Carnahan has an address for Perkins\ufffd and he should, since they exchanged papers at the scene of the accident \ufffda more viable means of giving notice to Perkins is possible, through in-hand service at his home in Missouri or some form of mail notice to that address. Thus, publication is hardly the type of notice \ufffd\ufffdone desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\ufffd\ufffd Mullane, 339 U.S. at 315. D is a little tricky. Serving Walker, the president of Ace, \ufffd\ufffdin hand\ufffd\ufffd (that is, by handing the papers to her personally) is surely a sufficient means of informing the corporation of the action. Service of process on a corporate officer is commonly authorized by statutes governing service of process on corporations. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B) (service may be made on corporation by delivery of summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation). And, such service is constitutionally adequate because it is very likely to make the officers\ufffdwho must respond to the suit on behalf of the corporation\ufffdaware of the pendency of the action. However, service on Walker, even in New Hampshire, does not give the New Hampshire court personal jurisdiction over the corporation. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that an individual defendant is usually subject to personal jurisdiction in a state if she is served with process in the action within the forum state. Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604 (1990). However, instate service on an employee or officer of a corporation does not establish personal jurisdiction over the corporation itself. Otherwise, a corporation could be sued wherever its officers traveled. Although Burnham reaffirmed that an individual is subject to jurisdiction based on symbolic \ufffd\ufffdseizure\ufffd\ufffd in the state, a corporation cannot be. That leaves C, which is the best choice. Certainly, there is a basis for the New York court to exercise jurisdiction over Perkins for this claim, since it arises out of the New York accident. And, constitutionally adequate notice is provided as well. Sending the summons and complaint to Perkins by certified mail at his home is a method very likely to actually reach Perkins and inform him of the pendency of the action. Many service statutes authorize service by various forms of mail and have been held constitutionally sufficient. So, assuming that the service statute authorizes mail notice, both due process requirements are met here.",

Personal jurisdiction in New Hampshire is possible if Ace has sufficient minimum contacts with New Hampshire. {QC 2}.  This is plausible as Perkins was making a delivery for Ace when the accident occurred in New York, potentially establishing a connection to New Hampshire through the lawsuit, depending on the extent of Ace's business in New Hampshire. {QC 7} However, the connection is weaker than in option C, and the accident occurred in New York, not New Hampshire.\n\n\nStep 6: Comparing the options, Option A fails due to insufficient personal jurisdiction.

Option C is the closest to meeting both requirements, although personal jurisdiction remains questionable.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, none of the options are completely satisfactory, but Option C comes closest to meeting both constitutional standards for notice and personal jurisdiction, although the latter remains uncertain.\n\n\nFinal Answer:  None of the options definitively satisfy both requirements.

            "Context": "More technicalities: Serving process on individual defendants in federal cases. So, Rule 4(c) mandates delivery of the summons and complaint to the defendant in federal cases, as do most state rules of civil procedure. Now, how  should the papers be delivered? For federal cases, the Federal Rules specify proper methods for serving process on different types of defendants, such as individuals, corporations, and political subdivisions. This section will focus on the methods for serving individuals. \ufffd Rule 4(e) authorizes service on an individual defendant\ufffdthat is, a person\ufffdby delivering the summons and complaint to her personally. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(A). This is fairly straightforward \ufffdyou take the papers to the defendant and physically give them to her. \ufffd Alternatively, you may deliver them to the individual\ufffds home and leave them with a person of \ufffd\ufffdsuitable age and discretion\ufffd\ufffd who lives there.

P. 4(e)(2)(C). It must be a person the defendant has specifically authorized to receive process in a lawsuit or who is designated by statute as authorized to receive service, not just a person who works for the defendant or is a general agent in her business. (A defendant might have appointed an agent for service of process in a contract, for example.) \ufffd Alternatively, Rule 4(e)(1) allows you to  use state service of process methods  for the courts of the state in which the case is pending  or  for the state in which service of process is made. So, if you sue in the Eastern District of Michigan, and you are serving process on a defendant in the Eastern District of Washington, you may use the methods of service of process authorized by Michigan law for the state courts of Michigan or those authorized by Washington law for the state courts of Washington. Frequently, these state rules will allow methods not authorized by the Federal Rules, such as service by mail. See, e.g., Michigan Civil Rules 2.105(A)(2) (authorizing service by registered or certified mail). If so, a plaintiff may use these methods instead of one of the methods authorized by Rule 4(e)(2).

She serves Moe several weeks later, by having the investigator deliver the summons and complaint to Fields at his office in New York. She serves Curley by mailing the summons and complaint to Curley at his home in Michigan by first class mail. All three move to dismiss for improper service of process under Rule 12(b)(5). She serves West by having a constable in Los Angeles deliver the summons and complaint to West at her office. When West says she does not want the papers, the constable places them in front of her on the desk.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Service is proper on all four defendants. B.  Service is proper only on Larry and Moe, but not on Curley or West. C.  Service is proper on West and Curley only. D.  Service is only proper on West. E.  Service is not proper on any of the defendants.",
            "Analysis": "Service on Larry is improper in this case, because, no matter how suitable Fields\ufffds age and discretion may be, he does not live with Larry, he\ufffds a visitor. I suppose you could argue that he is \ufffd\ufffdresiding\ufffd\ufffd there for the weekend, but that is probably stretching the rule beyond the breaking point. There\ufffds a difference between residing and visiting. While I haven\ufffdt researched the cases, I\ufffdll guess that they make that distinction because a visitor is less likely to remember to give the papers to the defendant and less likely to care that the defendant learns of the court proceeding. You might find a judge who would hold this service sufficient, but why take the chance? Scratch  A  . . . and  B , since service is improper on Larry. Service on Moe is insufficient because nothing in the question indicates that Moe has appointed Fields his agent for service of process; he is only his business agent. Service is only proper under Rule 4(e)(2) (C) on an agent specifically designated to receive service of process in a lawsuit. Service is not proper on Curley either, though Skelton\ufffds lawyer came close this time. Although Federal Rule 4(e) does not expressly authorize service of process by mail, Rule 4(e)(1) allows service under the service of process rules for the state in which service is made, which in this case is Michigan. As noted above, Michigan allows service of process by mail . . . but only by registered or certified mail. Close, but no cigar; drop  C . How about West? Rule 4(e)(2)(A) authorizes Skelton to deliver the papers to West personally. But here, Skelton delivered them in California for a law suit in Virginia. Does that satisfy the rule? Sure it does. The point of service of process is to  let the defendant know  that she has been sued, and handing the summons and complaint to West is just as effective to do that, whether they are delivered in L.A. or in Richmond. Rule 4(e)(2)(A) doesn\ufffdt say anything about  where  the papers must be delivered. But here West refused to take them; is service still proper? Yes it is. Skelton delivered them to her, made her aware of them, and left them with her. Surely, West can\ufffdt prevent valid service by refusing to put out her hand. So  D  is the best answer.",

The investigator left the summons and complaint at Larry's home in Virginia, but it was given to his booking agent.  This may or may not be considered a person of suitable age and discretion, but it is a method authorized by Rule 4(e)(1) using Virginia's state rules which might allow this method of service.

Mailing the summons and complaint is not a method of service authorized by Rule 4(e)(2).  While Rule 4(e)(1) allows using state methods, the question doesn't state that Michigan allows service by mail for this type of case. {QC 4}, {QC 8}\n\nStep 4: Service on West is improper.  The constable's actions do not constitute proper service under Rule 4(e)(2).

            "Context": "Service of process on a corporation under Federal Rule 4. Rule 4(h) provides several options for serving process on a corporation, when service is made in a judicial district of the United States. \ufffd Service may be made by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer of the corporation, for example, the president, vice-president, or secretary of the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). The phrase \ufffd\ufffddelivering a copy\ufffd\ufffd means physical delivery, not mailing. \ufffd Alternatively, service may be made by delivering a copy to a managing or general agent of the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h) (1)(B). This provision is the most ambiguous part of Rule 4(h), because it is unclear who will qualify as a \ufffd\ufffdmanaging or general agent\ufffd\ufffd of a corporation. In deciding whether a person is a managing or general agent, the court will consider how much authority the person served has in the general management of the business at the place where service is made. The logic is that a person with broad responsibilities will more likely recognize the importance of the papers and feel a responsibility to see that the proper people find out about them and defend the case. \ufffd Service may also be made on an agent authorized by law or appointment to receive service of process for the corporation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). Many states have statutes providing that a corporation registered to do business in the state appoints the state\ufffds Secretary of State as its agent for service of process in actions brought against the corporation. These statutes typically require the plaintiff, if he serves process on the Secretary as agent for the corporation, to give notice by mail directly to the corporation as well. \ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(A) authorizes service \ufffd\ufffdin the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an individual.\ufffd\ufffd This is confusing, because Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 4(e)(1), allows service  on an individual  by the methods of service authorized by the state where the action is pending or the state where process is actually served. Read literally, this seems to suggest that the plaintiff in a case against a corporation can use the state law methods  for serving an individual.  However, this reference is clearly intended to authorize a plaintiff to serve process on a corporation under state rules for serving  a corporation . Well, let\ufffds probe the limits of these provisions with another question. Be sure to consult the Rule itself in testing what was done against the requirements of the Rule.",
            "Question": "7. Special delivery.  PourPack is a Delaware corporation that sells dairy products to retailers. Its headquarters, offices, and freezers are in California. Girardi, a sales representative for PourPack in Utah, sues PourPack for firing him from his job, claiming age discrimination and seeking damages under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. His lawyer, Perini, files the action in federal district court in Utah. In which of these cases is service of process most likely to be upheld? Perini serves PourPack by",
            "Options": "Options: A.  delivering the summons and complaint to Suares, a member of the board of directors of Pourpack. B.  delivering the papers to the Utah Secretary of State, based on a Utah statute that authorizes such service in actions against a corporation arising out of its activities in Utah and mailing a copy of the papers (as required by the statute) to PourPack at its corporate address. PourPack argues that this is improper because Girardi\ufffds claim arises under federal law. C.  having a process server deliver the summons and complaint to Riggins, the vice-president of PourPack. Riggins is not home when the process server knocks, so he leaves the papers with Riggins\ufffds roomate, Schwartz. D.  delivering the summons and the complaint to Porado, a biochemist who is in charge of testing PourPack\ufffds products for spoilage.",
            "Analysis": "In  D , Perini apparently relies on Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B), claiming that he has delivered the papers to \ufffd\ufffda managing or general agent\ufffd\ufffd of PourPack. This phrase properly applies to an employee with broad supervisory responsibilities, who is likely to act generally for the corporation in the management of its business, at least at the office where he or she works. Porado is very much a specialist, with narrow responsibilities for product testing. Perhaps a mellow federal judge would find her to be a \ufffd\ufffdmanaging agent,\ufffd\ufffd but most probably would not. See, e.g.,  Street v. Steel Valley Industrialized Center , 2006 W.L. 2172550 (W.D. Pa) (service on \ufffd\ufffdIntake Eligibility Specialist\ufffd\ufffd did not satisfy Rule 4(h)). So this is not the choice \ufffd\ufffdmost likely to be upheld.\ufffd\ufffd In  C , Perini appears to rely on the subsection dealing with service on an individual, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(B). But she is not serving Riggins as a defendant in the action, she is serving PourPack. So she has to follow the procedure for serving a corporation in Rule 4(h)(1). Subsection (B) of that rule authorizes service on the corporation by delivering the papers to an officer of the corporation, not leaving them with someone else. But wait, how about Rule 4(h)(1)(A), which allows service in a manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving an individual? Rule 4(e)(1) allows use of state service or process methods, but the reference in Rule 4(h)(1)(A) almost certainly means state methods for serving process on a corporate defendant, not an individual defendant. So, unless state law allows service on a corporation by leaving the papers with someone else at the home of a corporate officer (very unlikely), service here is probably insufficient. Service in  B  is proper, however. Here, Perini has used a method of service authorized by Utah state service of process rules for serving a corporate defendant. Rule 4(h)(1)(A) authorizes Perini to use the service rules of the state in which the suit is filed, and she has properly looked to the Utah rules for serving a corporation. However, what about PourPack\ufffds argument that she has used state service of process rules in an action based on federal law? So what? Nothing in Rule 4(h)(1)(A) suggests that service can only be made under the state rules if the case is based on state law. Rule 4(h) prescribes general methods for service in federal actions, 2  without regard to the type of claim the plaintiff asserts and authorizes by reference what Perini has done here. A  is wrong here, because there is a difference between an officer of a corporation and a  director  of a corporation. Rule 4(h)(1)(B) authorizes service on an officer, because officers are almost always involved in the daily operation of the corporation and hence likely to take the steps necessary to present a defense to an action. Directors, by contrast, sit on a board that meets periodically to provide broad oversight and strategic direction, may not live near the corporate offices, frequently do not participate in the day to day management of the corporation, and are not as likely to be familiar with the dispute and take appropriate steps to defend the case.",

            "Context": "Waiver of service. All of this is fairly technical, though important. But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by \ufffd\ufffdfirst-class mail or other reliable means.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn\ufffdt too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that\ufffds a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service. But it provides that the penalty for failure to waive is to pay the cost of formal service (Rule 4(d)(2)), clearly implying that if the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must serve her with a copy of the summons and complaint through one of the formal methods provided in Rule 4. So, consider these scenarios.",
            "Question": "8. Technical fouls.  Eban brings suit against Lorenzo for interference with business relations. Eban\ufffds lawyer, Darrow, calls Lorenzo\ufffds lawyer, Sadecki, and tells her that he is filing suit that afternoon. In which of the following scenarios may the case proceed without formal service of process?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Darrow files the complaint with the district court clerk with an affidavit swearing that he informed Sadecki of the case and mailed her a copy of the complaint. B.  Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by first class mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He files an affidavit with the court attesting to those acts. C.

Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by certified mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He receives the green postal receipt back in the mail. Darrow files the postal receipt with the court. E.  In each of these scenarios, there is no proper waiver and formal service must be used.",
            "Analysis": "Interestingly, in each of these cases the defendant, or his counsel,  has been informed of the filing of the case . But actual notice is not a substitute for proper service of process or waiver of the requirement of service. Many cases have been dismissed for lack of proper service, even though the defendant knew that she had been sued or even received a copy of the complaint. See Moore\ufffds Federal Practice \ufffd4.03[3][a]. Service is a formal act by which a court asserts its authority over the defendant. The cases require that it be done by the book in order to acquire that authority. Knowledge of the action by the defendant or someone who works for it will not substitute for formal submission to the court\ufffds authority through service (or a proper waiver). So we have to see if the defendant has properly waived service in any of these cases. In  A , Darrow has attested to telling Lorenzo\ufffds counsel about the case. But he hasn\ufffdt served him with process, and he hasn\ufffdt complied with the Rule 4(d) procedure for waiving it. The court has not acquired jurisdiction over Lorenzo. He has been sloppy in  B  as well. A waiver is not obtained by sending a request for it, even if it includes all the information required in Rule 4(d)(1). A waiver is obtained when the defendant signs and returns the waiver form. Nothing indicates that Lorenzo did that in  B . And in  D , Darrow gets back the post office receipt showing that Lorenzo got the form, but that doesn\ufffdt constitute a waiver by Lorenzo. It only means that he received the request to waive service. In  C , Darrow sent a proper request for waiver, with the complaint, and got it back signed. But he didn\ufffdt send a formal summons from the court. That\ufffds all right. A formal summons, signed and sealed by the clerk, is required for proper service (see Rule 4(c)(1)), but is not required for a proper waiver. The whole point is that defendant waives this formality. See Rule 4(d)(1), which provides in part that \ufffd\ufffdthe plaintiff may . . . request that the defendant waive service of a summons.\ufffd\ufffd So Lorenzo has waived service in  C , and it, not  E , is the best answer.",

            "Context": "The basic federal venue provisions. Venue in most federal actions is governed by 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391(b), which provides: (b) Venue in general. A civil action may be brought in\ufffd (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, a judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court\ufffds personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. Note that subsections 1 and 2 are alternatives. Venue is proper in a district where  either  a defendant resides (if they are all residents of the state where the action is brought)  or  a district in which a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. Section 1391(b)(3) is a \ufffd\ufffdfallback\ufffd\ufffd venue provision that is only available in unusual circumstances: when there is  no district , anywhere in the United States, where venue would be proper under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). If the defendants all reside in the state where suit is brought, or if a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in some federal judicial district, or if property that is the subject of the action is found in a district, \ufffd1391(b)(3) cannot apply, because there will be at least one district in which venue is proper under \ufffd1391(b)(1) or (b)(2). Note also that there is a nasty proviso in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391(a) that poses a trap for the unwary: The first sentence of that subsection provides that the venue options in \ufffd1391(b) apply \ufffd\ufffdexcept as otherwise provided by law.\ufffd\ufffd Section 1391 is a general venue statute that applies unless  there is a special venue statute for the type of claim the plaintiff brings.

If there is a special venue statute for a particular type of claim, it may be interpreted as  displacing  the general venue choices in \ufffd1391(b)\ufffdthat is, as providing alternative, exclusive venue choices for such claims\ufffdor as providing  additional  venue choices for those claims, along with those in \ufffd1391(b).

So \ufffd1391(b)(1) doesn\ufffdt provide any venue options for Dziezek. He\ufffdll have to look to \ufffd1391(b)(2) or (b)(3). Section 1391(b)(2) is more fruitful. It allows venue in a district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim took place, or where property that is the subject of the action is located. Here, you might argue that the property in the Southern District of Ohio, where the subdivision is being built, is the subject of the action. This is doubtful, since the action is for fraud, not to establish an interest in the real estate. However, venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio anyway. Arguably, the partial construction of the subdivision in that district was a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim. But perhaps not; the claim really arises from the refusal of financing, not from the construction itself.

Here, the Southern District of Ohio is proper. The Western District of Tennessee, where the parties negotiated the contract, would also be proper under \ufffd1391 (b)(2). Since Dziezek could choose either of those districts under subsection 2, and both defendants would be subject to jurisdiction there based on their involvement in the subdivision project, \ufffd1391(b)(3) never comes into play.

            "Context": "Venue in cases involving corporate defendants. The venue provisions in \ufffd1391(b) also apply in cases involving corporate defendants. Such cases may still be brought in a district in which all defendants reside, or where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place. And subsection (3) is solely a fallback provision in cases involving corporate defendants, as in all other cases. But there is a confusing twist in cases involving corporate defendants. The twist arises from the definition of where a corporation \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd for purposes of applying the venue provisions. Two subsections of \ufffd1391 deal with this. The first, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391(c)(2), provides that in cases where a corporation is the defendant, it shall be deemed to reside \ufffd\ufffdin any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court\ufffds personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question. . . .\ufffd\ufffd The second, \ufffd1391(d), defines what district a corporation resides in if a state has more than one judicial district. It is even more perplexing: For purposes of venue under this chapter, in a State which has more than one judicial district and in which a defendant that is a corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time an action is commenced, such corporation shall be deemed to reside in any district in that State within which its contacts would be sufficient to subject it to personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate State, and, if there is no such district, the corporation shall be deemed to reside in the district within which it has the most significant contacts. These two provisions are admittedly a little grim. Basically they provide (\ufffd1391(c)(2) for a single-district state and \ufffd1391(d) for a multi-district state) that a corporate defendant resides in any judicial district in which its contacts would support personal jurisdiction over it for the plaintiff\ufffds claim. Why do we care where the corporation resides? Because \ufffd1391(b) allows venue in a district where all defendants reside. Section 1391(c) defines the residence of a corporate defendant  for purposes of applying \ufffd1391(b)(1). Let\ufffds do an example; maybe it\ufffdll help. Imagine that Sampson Corporation is incorporated in Delaware (a single-district state). Sampson has its principal place of business in Richmond, in the Eastern District of Virginia, but no other contacts in Virginia. Teller (a driver for Sampson, who lives in Delaware) has an accident with Rimini in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. What venues would be proper in Rimini\ufffds action against Sampson Corporation for her injuries? Well, she could sue in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, basing venue on \ufffd1391(b)(2), right? Certainly the accident in that district is a substantial part of the events giving rise to her claim. But she could also choose to sue Sampson in any district in which it resides; \ufffd1391(b)(1) tells us that. And \ufffd1391(c)(2) tells us that Sampson resides in Delaware, since it could be sued in that district based on general in personam jurisdiction. See Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 131 S. Ct. 2846, 2853-2854 (2011) (place of incorporation a paradigm case for general in personam jurisdiction). And \ufffd1391(d) tells us that Sampson resides in the Eastern District of Virginia, since its principal place of business is there. See  id.  (citing principal place of business as another paradigm case for general in personam jurisdiction). So Sampson\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdresidences\ufffd\ufffd offer two additional venues for Rimini\ufffds action. Just for contrast, suppose that Rimini sues Teller along with Sampson Corporation. The Eastern District of Pennsylvania is still a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(2). And the District of Delaware is also a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(1), because both defendants reside in Delaware: it is Teller\ufffds domicile and Sampson resides there under \ufffd1391(c)(2). But the Eastern District of Virginia is not a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(1), because only one of the defendants resides there.

            "Analysis": "This question didn\ufffdt give my students much trouble.  A  is pretty clearly wrong. Although \ufffd1391(b)(2) allows suit in a district where property that is the subject of the action is located, the exercise machine is not \ufffd\ufffdthe subject of the action.\ufffd\ufffd This provision of \ufffd1391(b)(2) addresses cases in which an interest in property, such as a parcel of real estate or a bank deposit, is disputed, not a situation like this, in which the claim is for injury caused by a piece of personal property. This is not a suit about an interest in property; the \ufffd\ufffdsubject of the action\ufffd\ufffd is the personal injury to Chu. B  is another loser. First of all, Jackson doesn\ufffdt \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd in Colorado based on a two-week time share. Courts have usually equated an individual\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdresidence\ufffd\ufffd with her domicile, and the venue statute confirms this interpretation. See \ufffd1391(c)(1) (natural person\ufffds residence for venue purposes is the district of her domicile). (Remember that basing \ufffd\ufffdresidence\ufffd\ufffd on being subject to personal jurisdiction in a district doesn\ufffdt apply to individuals, just corporations, under \ufffd1391(c)(2) and (d).) In addition, Sweda-Trak doesn\ufffdt reside in Colorado either. Section 1391(d) tells us that it \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd for venue purposes in districts where it would be subject to personal jurisdiction for the plaintiff\ufffds claim. After Goodyear Dunlop Tires  and  Daimler A.G. v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117 (2014), Sweda-Trak would only be subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Texas. Nor would it be subject to specific in personam jurisdiction there based on Jackson\ufffds act of selling the exercise machine to Chu there. That\ufffds a contact of Jackson\ufffds. He took the machine there and sold it there. Sweda-Trak did nothing in Colorado at all, and its machine is not its \ufffd\ufffdagent for service of process,\ufffd\ufffd subjecting it to jurisdiction wherever a third party takes it. So Colorado is not a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(1). The Southern District of California is proper, however, under \ufffd1391(a)(2), since Chu suffered his injury there. Surely that is a \ufffd\ufffdsubstantial part of the events . . . giving rise to the claim.\ufffd\ufffd So  C  is correct. Note, by the way, that Chu probably couldn\ufffdt actually sue Sweda-Trak in the Southern District of California. It does business only in Texas, and did not sell the exercise machine into California, so (under the logic of  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286 (1980)), it would not be subject to personal jurisdiction there for Chu\ufffds claim. But venue  would be proper in the Southern District of California, which is what the question asks. D  reflects the misconception that venue is only proper if  both subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) are met. Not so; venue is proper if the district satisfies one subsection or the other. Thus  C  prevails.",

Therefore, under \ufffd1391(d), it \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd in the Northern District, but not the Southern District.  B  is wrong. Although Cleveland Corporation, based on its principal place of business in the Northern District of Illinois, would be subject to personal jurisdiction  anywhere  in Illinois, that does not determine the venue analysis. Under \ufffd1391(d), Cleveland \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd only in the districts where its contacts would support personal jurisdiction if that district were a separate state. Its contacts in the Southern District would not support personal jurisdiction over it if the Southern District were a state, since it has no contacts there at all. A  is also dead on arrival. It relies on \ufffd1391(b)(2), which provides that venue is proper in a district where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim took place.

Arthur cannot obtain venue in the Southern District based on the fact that events giving rise to the claim took place in the Northern District. How about  D ? The accident that injured Cleveland in the Middle District of Georgia may be a \ufffd\ufffdmore substantial\ufffd\ufffd event giving rise to his claim than the manufacture of the toaster in Illinois . . . or, it may not be. It\ufffds hard to say that one underlying event is more substantial than the other.

We don\ufffdt have to choose which events are most substantial; the statute clearly contemplates that more than one district may be proper under \ufffd1391(b) (2). If important events giving rise to the claim take place in five districts (as, for example, large sales of a product that infringes a trademark in five districts), there may be five proper venues under subsection (b)(2).

Nothing that gave rise to the claim took place in the Southern District of New York, and no defendant resides there. Compagna, the individual defendant, resides in the Northern District of New York. Under \ufffd1391(d), Chem-Pro resides in any New York district in which its contacts would suffice to support personal jurisdiction. But as far as the question reveals, Chem-Pro has no contacts in the Southern District, so it does not reside there under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391(d). It is true that Chem-Pro would very likely be subject to general in personam jurisdiction in the Southern District of New York based on its principal place of business in the Western District. And a defendant that is subject to personal jurisdiction in a state is subject to jurisdiction in any court within that state , not just in a particular district. But even if Chem-Pro is subject to personal jurisdiction in the Southern District based on having its principal place of business in the state, that does not mean that it \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd in the Southern District  for venue purposes  under \ufffd1391(d). For a multi-district state, \ufffd1391(d) focuses on the defendant\ufffds contacts  in the particular district . We must ask whether those contacts would suffice to support personal jurisdiction over it if that district were a state. Here, Chem-Pro has no contacts in the Southern District, when viewed as a state, so it does not \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd there under the venue statute. Chem-Pro does \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd in the Western District of New York, because its contacts there\ufffdhaving its principal place of business there\ufffd would support general in personam jurisdiction over it if the Northern District were a separate state. Under \ufffd1391(b)(1), venue is proper in \ufffd\ufffda judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located.\ufffd\ufffd Since Compagna resides in the Northern District of New York, both she and Chem-Pro \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd in New York. Thus, venue is proper in a judicial district within New York where  either  resides. Either the Northern or Western District of New York is a proper venue. So  C  is right. B  is not right. It might be argued that Chem-Pro \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd in the Eastern District of Michigan for venue purposes, based on its large factory in that district. After  Goodyear  and  Daimler , however, it almost certainly does not\ufffdit appears that general in personam jurisdiction is limited to the state of incorporation and the state of the principal place of business. Even if Chem-Pro were subject to general in personam jurisdiction there, Compagna, the other defendant, does not reside in Michigan. She visits there but lives in New York. An individual \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd for venue purposes in the district of her domicile, not other districts that she visits. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391(c)(1). So venue is not proper in the Eastern District of Michigan under \ufffd1391(b)(1), even if Chem-Pro \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd there. Nor is it proper under \ufffd1391(b)(2), since no events giving rise to Excelsior\ufffds claim took place in the Eastern District of Michigan. D  is wrong, because, while the District of Minnesota would be a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(2), it is not the  only  proper venue. The Northern District of New York is also a proper venue, under \ufffd1391(b) (1). Frequently there will be more than one proper venue in a case.

            "Context": "Forum non conveniens and transfer. So, venue is the \ufffd\ufffdthird ring\ufffd\ufffd in choosing a proper court, along with personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction. If all three rings are satisfied, the court has the power to hear the case. However, it doesn\ufffdt always do so. Sometimes a case is filed in a court that has subject matter jurisdiction over the case, personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and is a proper venue under the venue statutes, yet the court concludes, as a matter of common sense, that it should be litigated somewhere else. Suppose, for example, that Robinson, driving through Oklahoma on her way to her new home in Arizona, has an accident in Oklahoma driving a Mervin automobile, made by Mervin Motors in Ohio. Robinson wants to sue Mervin, a Texas corporation with its principal place of business in the Western District of Texas, for her injuries. She contacts a lawyer in Texas, who files suit on her behalf in federal court in the Western District of Texas against Mervin. That court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case (based on diversity) and personal jurisdiction over Mervin (general in personam jurisdiction, as approved in  Daimler , based on its principal place of business in Texas). It is also a proper venue: Mervin \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd in the Western District of Texas under \ufffd1391(b)(1) and (d). So Robinson has jumped through all the hoops, and the court has the authority to hear her case. But it doesn\ufffdt make a lot of sense for it to do so, since the events took place in Ohio, where the car was made, and Oklahoma, where it allegedly caused the accident. Why Texas for this case? In  Gilbert v. Gulf Oil Co. , 330 U.S. 501 (1947), the Supreme Court held that a federal district court could \ufffd\ufffddismiss for forum non conveniens\ufffd\ufffd in cases like this, on the ground that, even though it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the case, practical factors suggest that it should be litigated somewhere else. The  Gulf Oil  court noted a number of factors a judge should consider in deciding whether to dismiss for forum non conveniens. One set of factors, the so-called \ufffd\ufffdprivate interest factors,\ufffd\ufffd relate to the convenience of litigating the case. Such factors include the location of the events giving rise to the case, the ability to implead other parties in the court, the ability to take a view of premises involved in the dispute, and the location of relevant witnesses and documentary evidence.  Gulf Oil  also noted several \ufffd\ufffdpublic interest\ufffd\ufffd factors, including (among others) whether the dispute involves local people or events, and is likely to be decided under local law. In the Robinson example, both the private interest factors and the public interest factors point to litigating elsewhere\ufffdprobably Oklahoma\ufffd rather than in Texas, since the events took place in Ohio and Oklahoma, evidence is likely to be in those places, Oklahoma law is likely to govern, and Oklahomans\ufffdnot Texans\ufffdwould likely have an interest in observing the litigation and taking part (as jurors) in deciding it. In response to the  Gulf Oil  decision, Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1404(a), the federal transfer-of-venue statute. Under this section, a judge may  transfer  a case filed in her court that should be litigated elsewhere to the more appropriate federal district, instead of dismissing it for forum non conveniens. (a) For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented. This statute makes good administrative sense. Because the federal district courts are all units of the same system, Congress has the authority to provide for transfer of cases among them to promote efficiency. 1  And, because the case is transferred rather than dismissed, the plaintiff need not file a new complaint, serve the defendant with process again or face statute of limitations problems. The case is simply passed on to the more appropriate federal district, where the litigation continues. Although the standard for transfer (\ufffd\ufffdfor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice\ufffd\ufffd) is as broad as a barn, case law interpreting \ufffd1404(a) makes clear that the factors outlined in  Gulf Oil continue to govern the trial judge\ufffds discretionary decision whether to transfer a case to another district. However, since the consequences of transfer are less drastic, the presumption in favor of the plaintiff\ufffds chosen forum is somewhat weaker under \ufffd1404(a) than it would be under the common law forum non conveniens principle. Today, \ufffd1404(a), rather than the common law forum non conveniens doctrine, governs most cases that are brought in a federal court. If the case should be litigated in another district, (and if it \ufffd\ufffdmight have been brought\ufffd\ufffd in that district), the federal court will transfer it to that district under \ufffd1404(a) rather than dismiss for forum non conveniens. However, if the proper forum under the  Gulf Oil  analysis is in  another country,  the transfer statute does not apply; Congress could not enact a statute requiring courts in another country to accept transferred cases. Thus dismissal for forum non conveniens is the court\ufffds only option in cases like  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno , 454 U.S. 235 (1981), in which the court concluded that the case should be heard in Scotland. Forum non conveniens is also applied in state courts, which have no power to transfer cases to the courts of another state. If Jones files a case in a North Dakota state court that really ought to be litigated in Wisconsin, the North Dakota court will dismiss for forum non conveniens, leaving Jones to pursue his remedy by filing a new action in Wisconsin. Note that \ufffd1404(a) allows transfer of a case to a district \ufffd\ufffdwhere it might have been brought.\ufffd\ufffd The Supreme Court has interpreted this phrase to mean that the case can only be transferred to a district where it could have been filed originally, that is, one that would be a proper venue and where the defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction for the claim. 2   Hoffman v. Blaski,  363 U.S. 335 (1960). This substantially limits the court\ufffds options. For example, in  World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson,  444 U.S. 286 (1980), Oklahoma would certainly be an appropriate place of trial for the plaintiff\ufffds claim against Seaway, the New York dealership that sold the car. It would even be a proper venue under \ufffd1391(a)(2), since a substantial part of the events took place in the Oklahoma district where the accident happened. But, if the case were filed in a New York federal court, the  Hoffman  rule would bar transfer to an Oklahoma federal district, since it could not have been brought there, for lack of personal jurisdiction over Seaway.

If Ace prefers to litigate the case in a Texas state court, it should move to dismiss for forum non conveniens.

            "Analysis": "A good place to start in analyzing a transfer question is with the  Hoffman v. Blaski  limitation: the federal court cannot transfer to a district unless the plaintiff could have filed the case there or all parties consent to the transfer. In this case, Connors could not have filed suit in the Southern District of Texas, because it would not be a proper venue for the action. Ace does not \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd there based on its operations in the Northern District. Remember, \ufffd1391(d) requires that we look at each district and ask whether the defendant\ufffds contacts in that district would support personal jurisdiction over it for the plaintiff\ufffds claim. Ace has no contacts in the Southern District, so it does not \ufffd\ufffdreside\ufffd\ufffd there under \ufffd1391(b)(1) and (d). Even though Ace would presumably be subject to personal jurisdiction in a court in the Southern District, based on its Texas contacts with Connors that led to the suit, the action could not have \ufffd\ufffdbeen brought\ufffd\ufffd there under the venue statute, since Ace does not reside there under \ufffd1391(d) and no events giving rise to the claim took place there. Scratch  A  from the list. The court would have the authority to transfer to the Northern District of Illinois under  Hoffman v. Blaski.  Ace, the sole defendant, would be subject to general in personam jurisdiction there, since its principal place of business is there. Consequently, it \ufffd\ufffdresides\ufffd\ufffd in that district under \ufffd1391(b)(1) (as elucidated by \ufffd1391(d)). So Connors\ufffds action could have been brought in the Northern District of Illinois. Scratch  B  as well. Although the court would have authority under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1404(a) to transfer this case to the Northern District of Illinois, why would it? Most of the events giving rise to the claim took place in the Northern District of Texas. Connors did the work there, dealt with Ace employees there, and suffered the damages there. The programming was to be used in Ace\ufffds Texas office. The defendant, a corporation with a local office, would not be greatly inconvenienced or put to great expense to litigate this case in Texas. Some witnesses and evidence may be in Illinois, but it seems very doubtful that more would be there than in Texas. It seems highly unlikely that the convenience of witnesses and the interests of justice require transfer of this case to Illinois. So  C  takes the cake. The last choice is a real spaceshot. It suggests that a defendant who is sued in federal court but prefers state court could move to dismiss for forum non conveniens, arguing that state court is more appropriate. This effort to use forum non conveniens as a forum shopping tactic is not going to work. The federal court in Texas is not \ufffd\ufffdinconvenient\ufffd\ufffd because the defendant prefers state court. Forum non conveniens does not authorize a federal court to dismiss so that a party can litigate in state court instead. That would provide a form of \ufffd\ufffdreverse removal\ufffd\ufffd that is not authorized by the federal removal statutes. If the defendant\ufffds real argument is that a court in another state is preferable, the court can\ufffdif it agrees\ufffdtransfer to a  federal  court in the other state under \ufffd1404(a). Forum non conveniens will not allow the defendant sued in a federal court to avoid the federal court system, unless the proper forum is in another country. If that is the case, the federal court will dismiss the case even though it was properly filed in federal court.",

            "Context": "Complications, complications: Transfer under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1406(a). So, when a plaintiff files suit in a district that is proper under the venue statute, the court may hear the case. However, it might also transfer it if the  Gulf Oil  factors suggest that it should be litigated in another federal district. But suppose a plaintiff files in a district that is  not  a proper venue under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1391? Naturally, the defendant may move to dismiss such a case for improper venue, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). And, the court would be within its rights to grant the motion. But could it  transfer  the case instead, to a federal district in which venue is proper? This is the scenario addressed by 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1406(a). Section 1404(a) applies to cases in which the plaintiff chooses a proper venue and the court considers transferring the case elsewhere. Section 1406(a) applies when the plaintiff files in an improper venue and the court considers curing the problem by transfer. Section 1406(a) provides that, if the case is filed in an improper venue, the court \ufffd\ufffdshall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\ufffd\ufffd Note several things about the statute: first, it gives the federal district judge the authority to dismiss rather than transfer. Second, it allows the judge to transfer, even though the case is not properly before her (because venue is improper). And third, it limits the districts the case can be transferred to: It may only be moved to a district where it might have been brought. The cases interpret this limitation in \ufffd1406(a) the same as the similar language in \ufffd1404(a), that is, to limit transfer to a district that would be a proper venue and have personal jurisdiction over the defendants. A striking virtue of section 1406(a) is that it allows a court to save a plaintiff\ufffds cause of action if she files in the wrong venue shortly before the limitations period passes. Section 1404(a) would not authorize transfer: It applies to cases that are properly filed in the transferor district. But \ufffd1406(a) allows the court to transfer the case to a proper district rather than dismissing. Thus, the suit is not re-started in the transferee forum, but continued. As long as it was filed in the wrong venue before the limitations period ran, the judge can send it to a district that is proper under the venue statute, and it will continue on, even though it only reached the proper court after the passage of the limitations period. It also saves the plaintiff the trouble of drafting a new complaint, refiling it in the new district, and reserving the defendants with process. Here\ufffds an illustration.",

Zirkhov brings a diversity action against Pardee, a truck driver from Ohio, and Lugo Enterprises, his employer, for injuries in an accident that took place in the Western District of Kentucky. He files the action in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, where Lugo\ufffds principal place of business is located. Pardee, who lives in Ohio, moves to dismiss the action for improper venue.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The court would grant the motion to dismiss. Although the Western District of Kentucky would be a proper venue, the court has not been asked to transfer the action there, so it must dismiss. B.  The court would have the authority to transfer the action to the Western District of Kentucky under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1406(a) or to dismiss it. C.  The court must transfer the action to the Western District of Kentucky under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1406(a), since it is a proper venue. D.  The court will have to dismiss, since 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1406(a) only allows transfer to a district in which the case might have been brought. E.  The court could transfer the action under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1404(a) if doing so would be in the interest of justice.",
            "Analysis": "A good place to start is to ask whether venue is proper in the Northern District of Illinois. If it is, then \ufffd1406(a) is irrelevant, and that eliminates three answers off the bat. Venue is not proper under \ufffd1391(b). Section 1391(b)(2) is not satisfied, since no events giving rise to the claim took place in the Northern District of Illinois. And \ufffd1391(b) (1) is not satisfied, since only one defendant resides in Illinois. Scratch  E from the list, and focus on the answers that deal with application of \ufffd1406(a). A  is interesting. It suggests that the court can\ufffdt transfer on its own motion to save Zirkhov\ufffds case. Practically, however, the defendant is unlikely to move to transfer; she wants to get rid of the case, not send it somewhere else. And she has a perfectly good motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3). So she\ufffds not going to ask to transfer. And the plaintiff filed the suit; why would she ask to transfer it (other than to save her derriere if it looks like the court may dismiss). It is well established that the court may invoke \ufffd1406(a) on its own motion to transfer the case instead of granting Pardee\ufffds motion to dismiss it. That\ufffds why Congress enacted the section. Nibbling away at the edges, consider  D , which takes the position that the Illinois federal judge can\ufffdt transfer, since the case could not have been filed in the Western District of Kentucky. But it could have been. Because a significant part of the events giving rise to the claim\ufffdthe accident\ufffdtook place there, the Western District is a proper venue under \ufffd1391(b)(2), and both defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky based on minimum contacts. C  suggests that the judge must transfer under \ufffd1406(a) if there is another proper venue. The language of the statute leaves the decision whether to dismiss or transfer to the judge in the transferor district. Even if dismissing instead of transferring would croak the plaintiff\ufffds case, the court may dismiss under \ufffd1406(a). This would hardly be \ufffd\ufffdin the interest of justice\ufffd\ufffd in most cases, but it might be in some. So  B  reigns; the decision whether to dismiss is within the judge\ufffds discretion. Zirkhov should throw himself on the mercy of the court and plead for a transfer.",

            "Context": "The bad old days: The rule of  Swift v. Tyson. The First Congress recognized and addressed the problem of the substantive law to be applied in diversity cases in 1789. They passed the Rules of Decision Act, which has remained in effect, with almost no textual change, ever since. Today it reads: 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1652. State Laws as Rules of Decision The laws of the several states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as the rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply. This would seem to settle the matter. If a federal statute, constitutional provision, or treaty applies, it will provide the governing law. Otherwise, the federal court should apply relevant state law. In a federal question case, of course, federal law  would  apply, by definition. But in diversity cases and some others within the federal judicial power, state law should govern. Although this may have been the First Congress\ufffds intent, Justice Story interpreted the Rules of Decision Act (which I will refer to as \ufffd\ufffdthe RDA\ufffd\ufffd) more narrowly in  Swift.  Justice Story concluded that the phrase, \ufffd\ufffdthe laws of the several states\ufffd\ufffd in the RDA referred only to state statutes, not to the common law decisions of state courts. If the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a statute providing that \ufffd\ufffdThe only duty of care owed to a trespasser on a railroad right-of-way is the duty to avoid wilful and wanton conduct,\ufffd\ufffd  Swift  recognized that a federal court would be bound, under the RDA, to apply that state \ufffd\ufffdlaw\ufffd\ufffd in a diversity case. However, if there were no such statute, but Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that railroads owe trespassers a duty to avoid wilful or wanton conduct,  Swift  concluded that the RDA did not require the federal court\ufffdeven in Pennsylvania\ufffdto follow that decision. If it didn\ufffdt apply Pennsylvania law to such a case, what law was it to apply? Story thought the federal court should apply  the common law  to the case. He, and perhaps all judges at the time, thought of the common law as a general body of legal principles, carried over from English law and adapted to American conditions, to govern common types of disputes such as contract, commercial, and tort cases. They didn\ufffdt think of it as \ufffd\ufffdPennsylvania common law,\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdGeorgia common law,\ufffd\ufffd but as  the common law,  which every court applied and had the duty to apply correctly. Thus a Pennsylvania judge, a Florida judge, or a federal judge would examine all the authorities on an issue\ufffdsuch as the duty of care owed to a trespasser\ufffdand determine what the proper rule should be. All common law judges looked to the same broad sources for insight into the \ufffd\ufffdtrue rule\ufffd\ufffd of duty of care to trespassers, and applied the true rule as they deduced it from those authorities. 1 Proceeding from this premise, Justice Story concluded in  Swift  that the federal judge should look at relevant authorities, not just from New York (where the  Swift  case arose) but all jurisdictions, and secondary materials such as treatises as well, to determine the proper answer to the commercial law issue posed in that case. The question was not, \ufffd\ufffdWhat is the New York rule on consideration for cancellation of a debt,\ufffd\ufffd but rather, \ufffd\ufffdwhat is the proper common law rule with regard to consideration for cancellation of a debt?\ufffd\ufffd So, under  Swift,  federal courts in diversity cases routinely reached their own conclusions about the proper rule in common law cases, even if those conclusions contradicted the governing case law of the state in which they sat.

He alleges that the Railroad owed him a duty of due care, since it was aware that trespassers routinely used the right-of-way.

            "Analysis": "Actually, none of the above is true, except  D . Each mistakes the holding of  Swift v. Tyson  in one way or another. A  fails because Justice Story held that the Rules of Decision Act did not require federal courts to apply common law rules of the state in which they sat. Instead,  Swift  held that the federal court should make its own judgment as to the proper common law rule, based on its review of all relevant cases and secondary authorities. It might conclude that the willful/wanton rule was appropriate, and choose to apply it, but it might also conclude that the Pennsylvania cases did not represent the correct approach to trespasser liability, and apply a different rule under  Swift\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law\ufffd\ufffd approach. B  also contains a fatal flaw. It states that  Swift  required the federal court in a diversity case to apply Pennsylvania common law in deciding Thomas\ufffds case.  Swift \ufffds holding was quite the contrary: The point of  Swift was that the federal judge in a diversity case (even a Pennsylvania federal judge) did  not  have to apply Pennsylvania common law\ufffdthe decisions of the Pennsylvania state courts\ufffdin deciding the appropriate standard of care owed to Thomas. Under  Swift,  the federal judge was to apply the \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law,\ufffd\ufffd looking at relevant authorities from Pennsylvania, from other states, from English cases, and secondary authorities as well, in determining what the \ufffd\ufffdtrue rule\ufffd\ufffd of duty of care to a trespasser should be. Indeed, the mindset was, in a sense, that there was no such thing as \ufffd\ufffdthe common law of Pennsylvania,\ufffd\ufffd but rather a general body of law called  the  common law, that judges from all state and federal courts attempted to perceive and apply correctly. C  also misstates the holding of  Swift.  The RDA, even in the heyday of  Swift,  required federal courts to apply federal law where a federal statute or constitutional provision applied. Or, if a state statute or \ufffd\ufffdlocal usage\ufffd\ufffd applied, it should be applied in a diversity case. If there were no state statute or local usage involved, and no federal statute or constitutional provision at issue, the RDA did not dictate the governing law at all. Instead,  Swift v.

            "Analysis": "This question isn\ufffdt too hard, but it nicely illustrates the reach of the  Swift  doctrine. Here, the federal and state courts differ in their approach to exclusive contracts. The Kentucky company shops for Kentucky law, which is more favorable to its position, by suing in state court. But the diversity defendant seeks to displace Kentucky law with \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law,\ufffd\ufffd by removing to federal court  in Kentucky,  and arguing that the federal court should ignore Kentucky\ufffds rule. Under  Swift,  the federal court would make its own judgment whether to enforce an exclusive contact, so long as no state statute applied. Under Justice Story\ufffds rationale, that state and federal judges both looked to the same sources to ascertain the proper rule, the federal judge would make an independent judgment on the enforceability of the exclusive contract. A  fails because the federal court, under  Swift,  would have the authority to apply \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law,\ufffd\ufffd whether the case was filed in federal court or removed to it. Either way, the federal court was not bound by the state\ufffds approach to the issue.  B  is wrong, because  Swift  held that the RDA did not require federal courts to follow state decisions on common law issues.  C  is also wrong; under  Swift,  the federal court did not apply the local law of the state in which it sat (though it would respect certain \ufffd\ufffdlocal usages,\ufffd\ufffd such as property and water rights rules). Under Justice Story\ufffds worldview, the law could not be \ufffd\ufffdone thing in Rome and another in Athens.\ufffd\ufffd See  Swift,  41 U.S. at 19. If enforcing exclusive contracts was the proper rule, the federal court would apply it to a Kentucky case, whether Kentucky judges disagreed or not. Thus  D  is the best answer; the federal court would very likely make its own judgment whether to enforce the contract, under general common law principles. Note the options this provided to the out-of-state party in a diversity case. If Kentucky law favored Brown & Yellow (the out-of-state party) it could sue in Kentucky state court. Because in-state defendants may not remove in diversity cases (see 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1441(b)), Black & White would be stuck in the state court, with the state rule. If federal courts applied a more favorable rule under  Swift,  the out-of-state party could sue in federal court. In that scenario, Black & White would be stuck in federal  court, since there\ufffds no right to \ufffd\ufffdremove\ufffd\ufffd from federal court to state court. See  Chapter 4 , pp.  61-62.  Thus, the out-of-state defendant had a choice of different contracts rules, because it had a choice of two court systems.",

The fact that this diversity case comes to federal court by removal, rather than by Thompson\ufffds filing it directly in the federal court, does not change the fact that the federal court must apply state law to it. It would make no sense to allow federal courts to make up \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law\ufffd\ufffd in diversity cases removed to federal court, but require them to apply state law to those filed there directly. This would simply introduce a new type of discrimination, between cases filed initially in federal court and those removed to it.

That\ufffds equally true whether a diversity case starts in federal court or is removed to it. D  suggests that the federal court could apply its own views about the preferable duty-of-care rule, since no Pennsylvania statute applies and only an old, pre- Erie  Pennsylvania case covers the point.

It\ufffds still a case from Pennsylvania\ufffds highest court establishing Pennsylvania law.

It\ufffds a federal question case, or, as I prefer to call it, an \ufffd\ufffdarising-under\ufffd\ufffd case, because Zandrow asserts a claim against Beta that arises under a federal statute. However, Zandrow has also asserted a second claim, arising from the same facts, under state law. This, in modern parlance, is a \ufffd\ufffdsupplemental\ufffd\ufffd claim, a claim arising under state law that could not have been brought in federal court on its own, but is asserted along with another jurisdictionally sufficient claim. As noted in the question, the federal court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state breach of contract claim, since it arises out of the same case or controversy as the main federal claim. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a).  D  implies that federal courts should always dismiss such related state law claims in federal cases. But the grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \ufffd1367 clearly authorizes federal courts to hear related state law claims in federal cases. Section 1367(c) gives the federal court discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction, but the very existence of that discretion to decline jurisdiction in limited circumstances reaffirms that federal courts generally will hear supplemental state law claims in federal question cases. So what law should the court apply to the contract claim? Clearly, the court must apply state law to it. The basic premise of  Erie  is that federal courts cannot displace state law just because they have jurisdiction to hear a dispute. This logic applies equally to state law claims that are litigated in federal court based on either supplemental jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. In the one context, as in the other, the federal courts don\ufffdt have the power to make general contract law. Since the federal court has the power to hear the contract claim, but not to create the law to govern it, the federal court must apply state law to it.

            "Context": "Federal courts determining the content of state law. The  Erie  case established the basic proposition: A federal court hearing a state law claim\ufffdwhether in a diversity case or a federal question case with supplemental state law claims\ufffdmust apply the law of the relevant state to the state law claim, not make \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law.\ufffd\ufffd That, of course, provides a fresh problem for the federal judge in such cases: how is she to determine what the law of the state  is ? Sometimes this is easy. If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has recently decided a case on the duty of care to a trespasser on a railroad right of way, and reaffirmed the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge knows her course. But how often will that be true? More often, there will be an older state supreme court decision on point, or on an analogous point. Perhaps there\ufffds a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case from 1963 that reaffirms the willful/ wanton rule for railroad trespassers, or a 1982 case that  abandons  that rule for trespassers on residential property . . . or both! Or, perhaps there is dicta in a 1998 Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court opinion suggesting that the early case establishing the willful/wanton rule is inconsistent with modern tort principles of the state, including the 1982 case on residential trespassers. Suppose that all three of these cases are on the books, the 1963 decision reiterating the willful/wanton rule, the 1982 state supreme court decision changing the rule for residential property, and the 1998 appellate court decision doubting whether the willful/wanton rule would be followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court today. What should the federal court do? Early post- Erie  cases suggested that the federal court had to follow any state precedent on point, whether the state supreme court would be likely to decide differently today. Under this approach, the federal court, sitting in diversity and adjudicating a railroad trespasser case, would have to apply the 1963 case affirming the willful/wanton rule. That case is on point, and has not been overruled. Thus, it is \ufffd\ufffdgood law,\ufffd\ufffd even if it might\ufffdor even probably\ufffdwould be reconsidered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court if the issue reached that court today. The Supreme Court\ufffds early decisions suggested that the same would be true if the only case on point were from an intermediate appellate court, or even from a trial court. See  West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co.,  311 U.S. 223 (1940); Fidelity Trust Co. v. Field,  311 U.S. 169 (1940). This approach, however, is unnecessarily rigid. Under it, the federal judge would have to apply a rule even though she is firmly convinced that it would not be applied in the state court system, if the case got up to the state supreme court. Later, the Supreme Court recognized this and provided a more flexible approach for federal judges applying state law. Under this approach, the federal judge is to apply the state law as she concludes that it would be applied today by the supreme court of the relevant state. Under this \ufffd\ufffdsupreme court predictive\ufffd\ufffd approach, the federal judge has more latitude to conclude, even though older precedents are still on the books, that they would be swept away if the issue reached the state supreme court again. If she is firmly convinced, for example, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would overrule the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge could refuse to apply it, even though that 1963 case is still, as a matter of precedent, \ufffd\ufffdgood law.\ufffd\ufffd The federal judge would not lightly make the prediction that a state supreme court case would be overruled, however, since this would lead to application of a rule in federal court that is not yet\ufffdand perhaps never will be\ufffdthe law of the state. See, e.g.,  Carleton v. Worcester Ins. Co., 923 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1991) (warning that litigants should not expect that new [state law] trails will frequently be blazed in diversity cases). This question considers the dilemma of a post- Erie  judge trying conscientiously to fulfill her law-applying role.",
            "Question": "5. Predicting the present.  Laurel and Hardy are both injured in an accident in the State of Emporia, when their car is involved in an accident with Fields\ufffds and Connors\ufffds cars. Laurel sues Fields for his injuries in state court. Hardy sues Fields for his injuries in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Laurel alleges, in the state suit, that Fields is jointly and severally liable for all of his damages, even if Connors was partly at fault as well. Fields argues, however, that he is only \ufffd\ufffdseverally\ufffd\ufffd liable for his percentage of fault, that is, that if the jury finds he was 40 percent at fault, and Connors 60 percent, he should only be liable for 40 percent of Laurel\ufffds damages, instead of 100 percent. In the federal suit, Hardy alleges that Fields is jointly and severally liable for his full damages, and Fields raises the same defense, that under Emporia law he is only liable for his own percentage of fault. Both suits are filed in 2012. The state of Emporia law is as follows. The Emporia Supreme Court held, in 1911, in  Powers v. Hall, that tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for a plaintiff\ufffds full damages, even if another actor was also at fault in causing the injury. Over the years, the rule has been applied numerous times. In 1998, in Sholto v. Dickens,  the Emporia Supreme Court refused to change to several liability, but there was a vigorous dissent from two justices (out of the seven on the court). Since then, one of the judges who was in the majority in  Sholto  has left the bench and been replaced. Also, a neighboring state switched to several liability in 2000. Assume further that in 1995, a draft of the Third Restatement of Torts, promulgated by the prestigious American Law Institute, endorsed several liability as the appropriate rule. In 2001, it issued the final draft of the Third Restatement, which also favors several liability rather than joint and several liability. In Laurel and Hardy\ufffds cases",
            "Options": "Options: A.  both the federal and state judges will probably rule that joint and several liability applies. B.  the state judge will probably rule that joint and several liability applies, but the federal judge will probably rule that several liability applies. C.  the state judge will probably rule that several liability applies, but the federal judge will probably rule that joint and several liability applies. D.  both judges will probably rule that several liability applies.",
            "Analysis": "This question is a little dicey, because it requires an exercise of judgment, which means there is room for debate. But I think one choice is clearly the best. To assess the choices, let\ufffds first ask what the state trial judge will do in Laurel\ufffds case. Will it apply the 1911  Powers  case (reaffirmed in Sholto ), or will it conclude that the Emporia Supreme Court will overrule Powers ? There is little question that the state trial judge will apply Powers  and  Sholto.  A federal judge, under the \ufffd\ufffdstate supreme court predictive approach,\ufffd\ufffd has some flexibility to predict that the Emporia Supreme Court would overrule  Powers,  if the issue came before it today. But an Emporia state trial court cannot do that. It is bound by the current precedents from higher Emporia courts; that\ufffds what the system of precedent means. The Emporia Supreme Court is the supervisory, law- making court for Emporia. The law it makes must be applied by Emporia trial judges until it is overruled, whether the Emporia trial judge likes it or doesn\ufffdt, whether she predicts that it is fated for the scrap heap or not. So you can scrap choices  C  and  D , which both assume that the state judge would apply several liability. That reduces the options to  A  and  B , and the choice between them depends on whether the federal judge would conclude, based on the precedents described in the question, that  Powers  would be overruled if the Emporia Supreme Court decided the issue today. Only if the federal judge is convinced that Emporia\ufffds highest court would overrule  Powers could it apply several liability, ignoring  Powers. On these facts, that is extremely unlikely. True, there has been change in a neighboring state, and the ALI (the question assumes) has formally endorsed several liability. But the ALI had already indicated that it favored several liability in the draft of the Restatement  before  the Sholto  decision. Thus, the Emporia Court was aware of the ALI\ufffds position when it reiterated its commitment to joint and several liability in Sholto.  One of the judges who voted not to change Emporia law five years earlier is gone. But that leaves four from the  Sholto  majority . . . and who knows how the new justice will vote. In the end, perhaps the Emporia Supreme Court will revisit the issue, and maybe it will adopt several liability. But a federal judge sitting on a diversity case is not likely to conclude that it will on such mixed evidence. Only in the clearest case is she likely to hold that the rule that appears to be Emporia law, and that clearly would bind an Emporia trial judge, is not \ufffd\ufffdreally\ufffd\ufffd Emporia law.  A  is the best answer.",

The  Erie  case established the basic proposition: A federal court hearing a state law claim\ufffdwhether in a diversity case or a federal question case with supplemental state law claims\ufffdmust apply the law of the relevant state to the state law claim, not make \ufffd\ufffdgeneral common law.\ufffd\ufffd That, of course, provides a fresh problem for the federal judge in such cases: how is she to determine what the law of the state  is ? Sometimes this is easy. If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has recently decided a case on the duty of care to a trespasser on a railroad right of way, and reaffirmed the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge knows her course. But how often will that be true? More often, there will be an older state supreme court decision on point, or on an analogous point. Perhaps there\ufffds a Pennsylvania Supreme Court case from 1963 that reaffirms the willful/ wanton rule for railroad trespassers, or a 1982 case that  abandons  that rule for trespassers on residential property . . . or both! Or, perhaps there is dicta in a 1998 Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court opinion suggesting that the early case establishing the willful/wanton rule is inconsistent with modern tort principles of the state, including the 1982 case on residential trespassers. Suppose that all three of these cases are on the books, the 1963 decision reiterating the willful/wanton rule, the 1982 state supreme court decision changing the rule for residential property, and the 1998 appellate court decision doubting whether the willful/wanton rule would be followed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court today. What should the federal court do? Early post- Erie  cases suggested that the federal court had to follow any state precedent on point, whether the state supreme court would be likely to decide differently today. Under this approach, the federal court, sitting in diversity and adjudicating a railroad trespasser case, would have to apply the 1963 case affirming the willful/wanton rule. That case is on point, and has not been overruled. Thus, it is \ufffd\ufffdgood law,\ufffd\ufffd even if it might\ufffdor even probably\ufffdwould be reconsidered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court if the issue reached that court today. The Supreme Court\ufffds early decisions suggested that the same would be true if the only case on point were from an intermediate appellate court, or even from a trial court. See  West v. American Tel. & Tel. Co.,  311 U.S. 223 (1940); Fidelity Trust Co. v. Field,  311 U.S. 169 (1940). This approach, however, is unnecessarily rigid. Under it, the federal judge would have to apply a rule even though she is firmly convinced that it would not be applied in the state court system, if the case got up to the state supreme court. Later, the Supreme Court recognized this and provided a more flexible approach for federal judges applying state law. Under this approach, the federal judge is to apply the state law as she concludes that it would be applied today by the supreme court of the relevant state. Under this \ufffd\ufffdsupreme court predictive\ufffd\ufffd approach, the federal judge has more latitude to conclude, even though older precedents are still on the books, that they would be swept away if the issue reached the state supreme court again. If she is firmly convinced, for example, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would overrule the willful/wanton rule, the federal judge could refuse to apply it, even though that 1963 case is still, as a matter of precedent, \ufffd\ufffdgood law.\ufffd\ufffd The federal judge would not lightly make the prediction that a state supreme court case would be overruled, however, since this would lead to application of a rule in federal court that is not yet\ufffdand perhaps never will be\ufffdthe law of the state.

            "Question": "6. Deference due?  Red & Orange Taxicab Company has a contract with the Tennessee Southern Railway, allowing it exclusive access to the Railway\ufffds grounds to pick up and discharge passengers at the Memphis, Tennessee station. In 1942, after  Erie Railroad v. Tompkins  was decided, Blue & Green Taxicab Company starts picking up passengers at the station, arguing that Red & Orange\ufffds contract is unenforceable because such exclusive contracts are against public policy. Red & Orange brings a diversity action in federal court, seeking to enjoin Blue & Green from using the station grounds. The federal judge, under  Erie , is bound to apply Tennessee law, but assume that Tennessee has never decided the issue. The federal district judge concludes, after reviewing Tennessee cases in related areas, that Tennessee would hold such exclusive contracts enforceable. She therefore grants the injunction, barring Blue & Green from interfering with the contract. This decision is affirmed by the federal Court of Appeals. Later, in an unrelated case, Pazzolla sues Wren in a Tennessee state court to enjoin him from interfering with a similar exclusive contract. Assume that, at the time of Pazzolla\ufffds action, Tennessee appellate courts still have not addressed the issue. In determining the validity of the contract,",

C.  the Tennessee trial court judge would not be bound by  Red & Orange Taxicab , but would consider it for whatever persuasive value its reasoning may have. D.  None of the above is true.",
            "Analysis": "This question analyzes the precedential effect of a federal court\ufffds holding, after  Erie , as to the content of state law. Here, since there was no Tennessee case directly ruling on the validity of exclusive contracts, the federal judge had to look at holdings in related areas to predict how the Tennessee Supreme Court would view them. After doing so, she concluded that the Tennessee courts would enforce the contract. So she did. And the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, looking at the same suggestive, but tangential evidence about how the Tennessee Supreme Court would rule, reached the same conclusion. Now, a Tennessee state court judge has to decide the same issue. Is she bound by the federal Court of Appeals\ufffds holding on the point? How should she regard it? The Tennessee trial judge is not bound by the Court of Appeals\ufffds decision in  Red & Orange Taxicab , even though it was decided by the august federal appeals court. The federal court does not oversee Tennessee trial judges, nor can it overrule their decisions. In addition, the federal court is  not making law  when it decides a diversity case, it is simply applying Tennessee law as it understands it to be.  A  is wrong. Although the federal court\ufffds opinion about the content of Tennessee law will certainly be of interest to the Tennessee trial judge, she is not bound by the federal court\ufffds \ufffd\ufffd Erie  guess\ufffd\ufffd about it, since the federal court neither oversees the Tennessee trial courts nor makes the law of Tennessee.  B  is wrong as well; the trial judge is not bound to follow federal cases that have decided the exclusive-contract point, even from a federal appellate court. She is bound only by authority from courts above her in the Tennessee court system, which do indeed make the law of Tennessee. C , however, is accurate. The federal Court of Appeals\ufffds opinion, reflecting the considered judgment of three federal appellate judges about how the Tennessee Supreme Court would rule on the point, is certainly worthy of the trial judge\ufffds consideration, as  persuasive  precedent, even though she is not bound by it. If unpersuaded, however, the Tennessee judge would be free to rule otherwise.",

Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff\ufffds full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy\ufffds full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant\ufffds percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields\ufffds appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields\ufffds federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court\ufffds decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability.

If Fields\ufffds appeal is decided under a \ufffd\ufffdnew\ufffd\ufffd liability rule, it might have to be remanded for retrial, even though it was fairly tried under the law as the judge understood it at the time. This seems wasteful. On the other hand, by taking his appeal, Fields has challenged the trial judge\ufffds ruling that joint and several liability applies in Emporia. When the Court of Appeals reviews that ruling, shouldn\ufffdt it consider all the data concerning the content of Emporia law? And what better data could there be on the point than this new decision from the Emporia Supreme Court? It seems artificial to uphold the trial judge\ufffds conclusion about Emporia law on the ground that it was reasonable at the time, when we now know that it was wrong. On this reasoning, the Court of Appeals will reverse the judgment against Fields and remand the case for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The Court of Appeals, like the federal district court, must make its best guess at the content of Emporia law at the time it reviews the case, and it is now clear that several liability is the law of Emporia.

            "Context": "Which state\ufffds law? The message of the  Erie  case is clear: \ufffd\ufffdfederal court: apply state law in a diversity case.\ufffd\ufffd But there was an interesting twist in  Erie  that the Supreme Court didn\ufffdt discuss. Tompkins\ufffds accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York.  Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which  state\ufffds law, Pennsylvania\ufffds\ufffdwhere the accident happened\ufffdor New York\ufffds, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has \ufffd\ufffdchoice-of-law\ufffd\ufffd rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the \ufffd\ufffdlex loci delicti\ufffd\ufffd choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After  Erie  established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing  which  state\ufffds law to use in a case like  Erie.  Should federal courts develop their own \ufffd\ufffdchoice-of-law\ufffd\ufffd rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after  Erie , the Supreme Court addressed this issue in  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co.,  313 U.S. 487 (1941).  Klaxon  held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\ufffds accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\ufffds case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon  reasoned that  Erie  required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts  of the state where the federal court sat.  To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When  Erie  was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti  choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the  lex loci  rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\ufffds case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\ufffdor that of a third state\ufffdto govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under  Klaxon , that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\ufffds choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under  Klaxon ), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\ufffds, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\ufffds lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law , since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The  Klaxon  Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the  Erie  analysis.",
            "Question": "8. Your law or mine?  Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator.

He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\ufffds choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\ufffds choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved.

            "Options": "Options: A.  Vermont law to Whitney\ufffds case, because the accident happened in Vermont. B.  Rhode Island law to Whitney\ufffds case, because Rhode Island has an interest in providing compensation to a Rhode Island plaintiff. C.  Rhode Island law, because the action is brought in Rhode Island. D.  whatever state\ufffds tort law would have been applied if the case had been brought in a Vermont state court.",
            "Analysis": "Klaxon  holds the key to this question. It requires the Rhode Island federal judge to do what a Rhode Island state judge would have done, had the case been filed in a Rhode Island state court. If it had been, the Rhode Island judge would have used Rhode Island\ufffds choice-of-law rules to choose between Vermont tort law (which would uphold the release) and Rhode Island tort law, which probably would not. B  appears based on the premise that the Rhode Island court would apply whatever body of law would favor the resident plaintiff. But that isn\ufffdt Rhode Island\ufffds choice-of-law rule. Instead, it applies the law of the state of the injury, which is Vermont in this case. Consequently, the plaintiff\ufffds rights will be decided under Vermont law, even though the case is litigated in Rhode Island.  C  suggests that the federal judge should use the law of the state in which the federal court sits. This also isn\ufffdt accurate under  Klaxon.  A more accurate statement is that the Rhode Island federal judge should apply the same body of substantive law to the case  that a Rhode Island state judge would apply.  Often, that will be Rhode Island law. But in cases with connections to several states (which is likely to be true in many diversity cases), the federal judge must choose the law of another state, under  Klaxon,  if a Rhode Island judge would. So the judge in Whitney\ufffds case must look at Rhode Island\ufffds choice- of-law rule. It calls for (the question assumes) application of the law of the place of injury. That was Vermont, so we look to Vermont tort law, which enforces waivers. So  A  is the best answer. 2  Although Rhode Island wouldn\ufffdt enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. Whitney was pretty clearly ill-advised to sue at home. The combination of Rhode Island\ufffds  lex loci  choice of law rule and Vermont\ufffds enforcement of liability waivers leaves her client out in the cold (no pun intended). If she had sued in Vermont, Vermont might have chosen its own law under \ufffd\ufffdinterest analysis,\ufffd\ufffd but at least  might  have found Rhode Island\ufffds interests greater. Thus,  Erie  and  Klaxon  together suggest that lawyers should carefully consider the choice-of-law implications of the forum they choose in diversity cases.",

            "Context": "Guaranty Trust Co. v. York: First efforts at drawing a line. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, decided seven years after Erie, considered whether a federal court had to apply a state statute of limitations in a diversity case, instead of the \ufffd\ufffdlaches\ufffd\ufffd doctrine previously applied by federal courts in equity cases. Certainly, the question of what limitations period to apply to a case is a step closer to \ufffd\ufffdprocedure\ufffd\ufffd than the duty-to a-trespasser issue in Erie. It involves the issue of how long a party has to file suit, which relates to the litigation process, rather than the duty owed between parties outside of litigation. It was not at all clear that Erie meant that the Rules of Decision Act required a diversity court to apply such procedural rules in diversity cases. In Guaranty, the Court refused to resolve the issue by labeling a limitations period as \ufffd\ufffdsubstantive\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdprocedural.\ufffd\ufffd Instead, the Court looked to the underlying policy Erie sought to achieve, that the choice of state or federal court in a diversity case should not affect the outcome of the case. The intent of that decision [Erie] was to insure that, in all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court. 326 U.S. at 109. Under this rationale, if federal practice differs from state practice, the court should determine whether the case would come out differently if it applied its own rule. If it would, a federal diversity court should use the state rule instead. Since York\ufffds case might go forward if the federal court applied the federal laches doctrine, but was barred under the state limitations period, York held that the federal court should apply the state limitations period. Thus, York established an \ufffd\ufffdoutcome-determinative test\ufffd\ufffd for determining the reach of the Rules of Decision Act. The federal court should defer to a state rule if ignoring it could lead the case to come out differently in federal court than it would \ufffd\ufffdin a State court a block away.\ufffd\ufffd Consider how the following case would be resolved under this approach.",

Barnstable\ufffds counsel has service made under the federal approach, by leaving it at Noriega\ufffds home with her husband, on the day before the state limitations period expires.

            "Analysis": "If you\ufffdre up on your Erie line of cases, you will recognize  this as close to the facts of Hanna v. Plumer. But the question asks you  to assume that the case takes place well before Hanna was decided, so  you need to ask how it would be decided under the reasoning of York.  That case, and the other early post-Erie cases, did not clearly distinguish  conflicts between state law and a Federal Rule from conflicts between  state law and federal judicial practices unguided by the Rules. Under  York\ufffds approach, the cases asked whether ignoring the state rule was  likely to make the case come out differently in federal court than it would  in state court. If it would, the state rule would be followed.  So, C is wrong. It appeared, after York, that the federal courts would  not analyze a conflict involving a Federal Rule any differently than other  conflicts. The issue was whether using the state rule could lead to a  different outcome than using the federal approach. Under York\ufffds  outcome determinative test, it appeared that the federal courts would  defer to state law, even if the issue were arguably controlled by a Federal  Rule in federal court. Indeed, the Court applied state law in several cases  after York that arguably were controlled by a Federal Rule.2  B is also a weak answer, because York refused to choose between  state and federal law based on labels. York suggested that a federal court  should defer to state law in a diversity case, even on an issue that is  arguably procedural\ufffdor, presumably, clearly procedural\ufffdif ignoring  the state rule would lead to a different outcome in federal court than the  litigants would obtain in state court.  D is wrong too, because York\ufffds deference to state law did not turn on  the fact that the state approach was embodied in a statute. Rather, it  turned on the fact that the outcome could differ if the state\ufffds practice  were ignored. This logic suggests that a federal diversity court should  defer to the state rule, whether that rule was statutory, established by a  state rule of procedure, or a matter of state judicial practice, if failing to  do so would lead to a different outcome in federal court.  A is the best answer. Very likely, in the era after York, the Court  would have held, based on York\ufffds policy of conforming to state practice  to assure uniform outcomes, that the federal diversity court should apply  the state in-hand service rule, even if it directly conflicted with a practice  mandated by a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Under Minnesota\ufffds  approach, the claim would be barred, since Noriega was not served in  hand within the limitations period. Under the Federal Rule, however, the  limitations statute would be deemed satisfied, and the case would go  forward. Since using the Federal Rule would lead to a different outcome,  York appeared to require the court to use the state procedure instead.",

            "Context": "Byrd v. Blue Ridge: A caveat based on countervailing federal policies. Fundamentally, Erie was a constitutional decision, based on the premise that areas of law not delegated to the federal government remained with the states. The Erie Court rejected the idea that federal courts could \ufffd\ufffdmake up\ufffd\ufffd the law of contracts, torts or property simply because they had jurisdiction to hear diversity cases. But York mandated deference to state law even in areas where there was constitutional authority to make a separate federal rule. This was a big step, taken without much discussion of its implications by Justice Frankfurter in York. For example, Article III, \ufffd2 of the Constitution, together with the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, \ufffd8), provide constitutional authority for federal courts to apply their own rules on matters of procedure, like the method of service of process. A federal court would hardly be a court if it couldn\ufffdt organize itself (or be organized by Congress) and provide basic procedures for the conduct of judicial business. Yet Justice Frankfurter\ufffds outcome-determinative test required deference to state law even in such matters of litigation procedure. This broadened considerably the area in which federal courts deferred to state law. Erie had not suggested that such deference to state law would be required in procedural matters. York, in other words, expanded Erie from a constitutional doctrine, under which federal courts applied state law in diversity cases because there was no other constitutional possibility, to a broader doctrine based on the policy of promoting uniform outcomes in diversity cases in the two court systems. Since the purpose of diversity jurisdiction was merely to provide an alternative, presumably neutral forum, it should provide just that, a different forum that applied the same rules. That way, diverse plaintiffs would obtain no litigation advantage by virtue of their right to choose a federal court, only an unbiased forum applying the same law. This difference between deferring to state law for constitutional reasons and doing so for policy reasons, is important in understanding Byrd v. Blue Ridge. Where deference to state law is constitutionally mandated, it is not \ufffd\ufffdbalanced\ufffd\ufffd against other policies. The court applies state law because \ufffd\ufffdthere can be no other law.\ufffd\ufffd Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 472. But where the federal court could, constitutionally, apply its own rule, and is making a discretionary policy decision whether to apply state law to ensure uniform outcomes, the court may balance that uniformity policy against other policies. Sometimes, those other policies may be sufficiently strong to outweigh York\ufffds emphasis on uniform state/federal outcomes in diversity cases. That is the basic holding of Byrd. While Byrd is sometimes thought of as breaking with the York analysis, Byrd actually reaffirms both Erie and York. In Byrd, Justice Brennan reaffirmed that diversity courts must \ufffd\ufffdrespect the definition of state-created rights and obligations,\ufffd\ufffd as well as state rules \ufffd\ufffdbound up with rights and obligations of the parties.\ufffd\ufffd This restates the core constitutional holding of Erie, that the federal court must apply state law governing primary rights, because it has no constitutional power to substitute its own rules, as the Court had done under Swift v. Tyson. Justice Brennan then noted that the cases following Erie\ufffdnotably York\ufffdhad \ufffd\ufffdevinced a broader policy\ufffd\ufffd of conforming to state law where failure to do so might lead to a different result in federal court. In other words, York mandated deference to state law, as a matter of policy, even where such deference was not required by the Constitution. Thus, diversity courts had applied state rules \ufffd\ufffdeven of form and mode\ufffd\ufffd (that is, matters having to do with procedure in conducting the litigation, rather than primary rights like the duty of care owed to a trespasser) under the outcome-determinative test, although they would have constitutional authority to follow a separate federal practice. For example, on the facts of Question 1, a federal court would presumably follow the state service rule under York, although this is not a substantive matter as to which it is constitutionally bound to follow state law. Byrd expressed no general dissent from this outcome determinative test, even in matters of \ufffd\ufffdform and mode.\ufffd\ufffd However, Justice Brennan suggested that in matters of litigation procedure, where state practice is followed as a policy choice rather than as a constitutional imperative, the York policy of uniform outcomes should be considered along with other policies, which might sometimes outweigh the uniformity policy. In Byrd itself, the division of functions between the judge and jury in federal cases, under the \ufffd\ufffdinfluence\ufffd\ufffd of the Seventh Amendment, was an important consideration supporting the use of federal procedure in federal court. Since the state law was not \ufffd\ufffdbound up with rights and obligations of the parties\ufffd\ufffd (in which case the federal court would have to defer to it), the Court could consider \ufffd\ufffdaffirmative countervailing considerations.\ufffd\ufffd In Byrd, the federal priority given to the role of the jury outweighed the policy in favor of uniform state/ federal outcomes in diversity cases. So Byrd did not overrule York\ufffds deferential approach in diversity cases or question its central premise. Rather, it noted that in cases involving procedural differences between state and federal law, this policy-based deference could be outweighed by important policies concerning the integrity of the federal court system. Such balancing would only be appropriate, however, for matters of \ufffd\ufffdform and mode,\ufffd\ufffd issues of court procedure in processing cases, not for matters closely related to substantive rights. As to matters bound up with substantive rights, Erie and York continued to mandate use of state law. Transport yourself back to 1960 and consider how the following case would be analyzed shortly after Byrd was decided.",
            "Question": "2. Pocketbook policies. The state of Fredonia has a Consumer Protection Act that authorizes suits for unfair practices in consumer transactions. The statute authorizes plaintiffs who prevail on their claims to recover attorneys\ufffd fees in litigating the case as well. The purpose of the fees statute is to promote enforcement of consumers\ufffd rights by encouraging aggrieved parties (and their lawyers) to sue. Awarding fees to prevailing plaintiffs significantly increases recoveries, since they must otherwise pay their lawyers out of their damage awards. Assume that there is no provision in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for prevailing plaintiffs to recover their attorneys\ufffd fees, nor do federal judges allow them as a matter of judicial practice. In 1960, Bartholomew sues Abelard in federal court, based on diversity, for damages under the Fredonia Consumer Protection Act. She recovers damages, and moves for an award of attorneys\ufffd fees as well. In deciding whether to award fees to Bartholomew, the federal court should",

            "Analysis": "The key to this question is to understand how much of York was reaffirmed by Byrd. Justice Brennan did not suggest a general balancing test for Erie problems. Nor did he suggest that a state rule could be ignored as long as it was labeled \ufffd\ufffdprocedural.\ufffd\ufffd Rather, he reaffirmed that \ufffd\ufffdstate-created rights and obligations\ufffd\ufffd (like duty of care, or enforcing exclusive contracts), or matters closely \ufffd\ufffdbound up\ufffd\ufffd with such substantive rights must be applied in federal diversity cases. He went further. He affirmed that even in matters of \ufffd\ufffdform and mode,\ufffd\ufffd that is, matters of procedure in the court enforcement of substantive rights, a federal diversity court should generally defer to state practice, to ensure uniform outcomes. Only if important federal policies would be compromised by following state rules might the federal court choose to follow a federal procedural rule in the face of a contrary state rule. D is an interesting choice. It suggests that the difference between the federal and state approaches is not outcome-determinative, because Bartholomew can still win if the federal court uses its own approach to fees . . . he would just recover less. That is true, but it certainly leads to significantly different outcomes in state and federal court, if the plaintiff cannot recover fees in federal court. Ignoring the state fees statute would drastically reduce the plaintiff\ufffds recovery. In many civil cases, the fees award will exceed the plaintiff\ufffds damages, and the award of fees means that the plaintiff retains the entire compensatory award, instead of paying a significant part of it to her lawyer. If federal courts ignored this state fees statute, plaintiffs would virtually always sue in state court, and any defendant who could would remove, to avoid paying fees. So, though Bartholomew could still recover, denying fees would affect the outcome dramatically. Thus, York would lead to application of state law, unless Byrd balancing tips the scales toward federal law. C is wrong, because the fees statute is not fairly characterized as purely a matter of form and mode. The right to fees significantly enhances the substantive remedy for violations of the statute, and is either a \ufffd\ufffdstate-created right\ufffd\ufffd or at least \ufffd\ufffdbound up with\ufffd\ufffd the statecreated right to recover for consumer protection violations. Justice Brennan reaffirmed that in such cases state law applies, without regard to balancing federal procedural policies. Thus, A is wrong too, since it suggests that such balancing would be appropriate. B, then, is the best answer. For a matter so closely akin to state substantive law as this, Byrd would not change the analysis. State law would be applied.",

            "Context": "Second track:  Hanna v. Plumer That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer.  But  Hanna  changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule.  York  and  Byrd  both involved such conflicts.  York  involved a conflict between a state statute and the  judicial practice  of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And  Byrd  involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal  judicial practice  of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \ufffd\ufffdrelatively unguided\ufffd\ufffd  Erie  conflicts,  Hanna  reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in  Byrd\ufffds  language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \ufffd\ufffdthere can be no other law.\ufffd\ufffd  Hanna , 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\ufffds verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy  Erie  sought to further\ufffduniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\ufffdbut also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the  Hanna  opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of  York \ufffds outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are  not  prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \ufffd\ufffdinequitable administration of the laws,\ufffd\ufffd that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York  line of cases would  not  require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following  Question 1 .) That\ufffds  Hanna  Part I. It\ufffds dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in  Hanna , unlike in  York  or in  Byrd , the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna  construed Congress\ufffds power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \ufffd\ufffdrationally capable of classification\ufffd\ufffd as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \ufffd\ufffdoutcome-determinative\ufffd\ufffd test of  York,  or the more refined outcome-determinative test of  Hanna  Part I. But the rule involved in  Hanna  wasn\ufffdt written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \ufffd\ufffdprescribe general rules of practice and procedure\ufffd\ufffd for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(a). In  Hanna , the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\ufffds power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren interpreted \ufffd2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \ufffd\ufffdreally regulates procedure,\ufffdthe judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\ufffd\ufffd 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from  Sibbach v. Wilson & Co ., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\ufffds delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\ufffds own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\ufffds rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b) provides that the Rules \ufffd\ufffdshall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\ufffd\ufffd Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \ufffd2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \ufffd2072(b). In  Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the  Sibbach  test, and\ufffdeven if it is\ufffdit must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after  Hanna  is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \ufffd\ufffdmodified outcome-determinative test\ufffd\ufffd of Hanna  Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under  Hanna  Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \ufffd\ufffdSupreme Law of the Land.\ufffd\ufffd United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under  Hanna  Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under  Hanna  Part II?",

            "Context": "C. Second track:  Hanna v. Plumer That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer.  But  Hanna  changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule.  York  and  Byrd  both involved such conflicts.  York  involved a conflict between a state statute and the  judicial practice  of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And  Byrd  involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal  judicial practice  of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \ufffd\ufffdrelatively unguided\ufffd\ufffd  Erie  conflicts,  Hanna  reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in  Byrd\ufffds  language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \ufffd\ufffdthere can be no other law.\ufffd\ufffd  Hanna , 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\ufffds verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy  Erie  sought to further\ufffduniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\ufffdbut also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the  Hanna  opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of  York \ufffds outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are  not  prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \ufffd\ufffdinequitable administration of the laws,\ufffd\ufffd that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York  line of cases would  not  require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following  Question 1 .) That\ufffds  Hanna  Part I. It\ufffds dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in  Hanna , unlike in  York  or in  Byrd , the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna  construed Congress\ufffds power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \ufffd\ufffdrationally capable of classification\ufffd\ufffd as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \ufffd\ufffdoutcome-determinative\ufffd\ufffd test of  York,  or the more refined outcome-determinative test of  Hanna  Part I. But the rule involved in  Hanna  wasn\ufffdt written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \ufffd\ufffdprescribe general rules of practice and procedure\ufffd\ufffd for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(a). In  Hanna , the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\ufffds power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of  Hanna , Chief Justice Warren interpreted \ufffd2072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \ufffd\ufffdreally regulates procedure,\ufffdthe judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\ufffd\ufffd 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from  Sibbach v. Wilson & Co ., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\ufffds delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\ufffds own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\ufffds rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b) provides that the Rules \ufffd\ufffdshall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\ufffd\ufffd Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \ufffd2072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \ufffd2072(b). In  Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the  Sibbach  test, and\ufffdeven if it is\ufffdit must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after  Hanna  is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \ufffd\ufffdmodified outcome-determinative test\ufffd\ufffd of Hanna  Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under  Hanna  Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \ufffd\ufffdSupreme Law of the Land.\ufffd\ufffd United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under  Hanna  Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under  Hanna  Part II?",
            "Question": "4. Replay.  Assume that a case similar to  Guaranty Trust Company v. York  arose today, in which the plaintiff sued for restitution, an equitable remedy for the defendant corporation\ufffds conversion of certain notes. The local state statute of limitations had passed.

            "Options": "Options: A.  reversed, under the modified outcome determinative analysis in the first part of  Hanna v. Plumer.

D.  affirmed, because  Guaranty Trust Company v. York  was overruled in  Hanna v. Plumer.",
            "Analysis": "This one is fairly straightforward for an  Erie  question. Again, start by asking which branch of the decision tree to pursue: Hanna  Part I or  Hanna  Part II. To choose the right branch, look at the nature of the federal procedure involved. Here, the federal laches doctrine is a matter of judge-made practice, not required by a federal statute or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. So, to decide whether to use the state approach instead of the laches doctrine, we examine the factors discussed in  Hanna  Part I, whether using the federal approach instead would lead to forum shopping or inequitable administration of the laws. If it would, the court should apply state law, absent some federal \ufffd\ufffdcountervailing consideration\ufffd\ufffd not mentioned in the question. D  is a poor answer, because  Hanna  did not overrule  York. Hanna accepted the fundamental policy goal of  York , that federal courts should use state law if ignoring it would lead to greater litigation opportunities for diversity litigants.  Hanna  Part I refined this analysis by creating the \ufffd\ufffdtwin aims\ufffd\ufffd test, but did not overrule  York. C  is wrong, because the Rules Enabling Act is irrelevant to this case, which does not involve a Federal Rule. As  Hanna  Part II indicates, this question would be relevant if the federal approach were found in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. But it isn\ufffdt. B  is also dubious. Even if a federal judicial practice is \ufffd\ufffdarguably procedural,\ufffd\ufffd  York,  even as modified in  Hanna  Part I, requires the federal court to use state law instead if using the federal approach would lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws. Under  Hanna Part I, as under  York , the choice must turn on the policy of uniformity of outcomes, not on whether the federal court\ufffds practice can be broadly dubbed a matter of procedure. This \ufffd\ufffdarguably procedural\ufffd\ufffd phrase was used in  Hanna  to describe the power of  Congress  to govern practice in the federal courts, not to set a standard for choosing between a federal judge-made practice and state rules. So,  A  is the best answer. Today, as in 1945, a federal court would apply the state limitations period in this situation, to further the policy of uniform outcomes in diversity cases in state and federal court.",

            "Context": "Direct conflicts with the Federal Rules. After Hanna , a crucial first step in solving  Erie  problems is determining whether the case involves a conflict between a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and state practice, or a \ufffd\ufffdrelatively unguided\ufffd\ufffd conflict between federal judicial practice and state practice. One would think this fairly straightforward, but the Supreme Court hasn\ufffdt found it easy to decide when a Federal Rule directly conflicts with state practice. For example, in  Walker v. Armco Steel Corp ., 446 U.S. 740 (1980), state practice provided that the plaintiff must file suit within the limitations period and serve process in the action on the defendant within sixty days, to avoid being barred. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 3, however, an action is \ufffd\ufffdcommenced by filing a complaint with the court.\ufffd\ufffd If Rule 3 provides that filing the complaint satisfies the limitations period, an action (like the one in  Walker ) might be barred under state law\ufffdbecause service of process was not made in time\ufffdbut timely under the Federal Rule (because the complaint was filed within the limitations period). In  Walker,  the Court avoided the problem by holding that Federal Rule 3 did not address the issue of meeting the limitations period. Instead, the Court held that Rule 3 establishes the date for computing various time limits under the Rules\ufffdsuch as the time to answer the complaint\ufffdbut \ufffd\ufffddoes not affect state statutes of limitations.\ufffd\ufffd Id. at 751. Thus, the conflict was a  Hanna  Part I conflict, since there was no \ufffd\ufffddirect collision\ufffd\ufffd between the Federal Rule and the state statute. Consequently, the  Walker  Court looked to the modified outcome-determination analysis of Hanna  Part I, and concluded that the state limitations statute should apply, since the case otherwise could go forward in federal court but would be barred in state court. Since  Walker , several other Supreme Court cases have narrowly construed Federal Rules to avoid a \ufffd\ufffddirect collision\ufffd\ufffd ( Walker  at 749) with state law. See, e.g.,  Semtek International Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp ., 531 U.S. 497, 502-505, 1024-1027 (2001). Others, however, have found a direct conflict where a narrower reading seemed possible. In Burlington Northern R.R. Co. v. Woods , 480 U.S. 1 (1987), for example, the Court concluded that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, which allows but does not require an award of fees to a prevailing appellant, conflicted with an Alabama statute that imposed a mandatory penalty for unsuccessful appeals. Id. at 6-8. Since it found a direct conflict, the Court held that Federal Rule 38 would apply, despite the contrary Alabama provision. This question, whether there is a conflict between a Federal Rule and state procedural provision, is basically one of statutory construction. There\ufffds a lot of play here, and not too much help to be offered in predicting whether the court will find an irreconcilable conflict between the state rule and the Federal Rule. It seems likely, however, that where a logical limiting construction is possible that avoids a direct conflict, the court will lean towards that construction. Try this example for some \ufffd\ufffddirect collision\ufffd\ufffd practice.",

Assume that Rule 4(q) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a civil action in federal court is commenced, for purposes of satisfying the relevant statute of limitations, upon filing of the complaint with the clerk\ufffds office.

D.  apply the state approach, because there is no \ufffd\ufffddirect conflict\ufffd\ufffd between the two rules.",
            "Analysis": "Once again, the crux of the matter is which  Hanna  analysis to pursue, the refined \ufffd\ufffdtwin-aims\ufffd\ufffd analysis of Part I or the Federal Rule analysis of Part II. If the Federal Rule governs the issue before the court, and conflicts with the state approach,  Hanna  Part II mandates application of the Rule, as long as it does not modify or abridge substantive rights. Here, the (imaginary) Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(q) does apply, and does conflict with state practice. Federal Rule 4(q) expressly provides that filing suffices to meet the limitations period. This is directly contrary to Emporia practice, because the action may proceed in federal court if it is filed with the court before the passage of the limitations period, even if it is served on the defendant later. Under state practice, the case would be dismissed if the defendant was not served by that time. Thus  D  is wrong, because there is a direct conflict between the federal and state approaches. The two provisions are irreconcilable, since the one allows what the other does not. And, because it is a conflict between a Federal Rule and state practice, the \ufffd\ufffdtwin aims\ufffd\ufffd test of Hanna  Part I, referred to in  C , is also irrelevant. Even if applying the Federal Rule would lead to forum shopping or inequitable administration of the laws, it applies in federal court if it is valid. B  is also a little off, because the question isn\ufffdt whether Congress could enact Rule 4(q), but whether  the Court  could adopt it under the Rules Enabling Act. The REA allows promulgation of \ufffd\ufffdarguably procedural\ufffd\ufffd rules, but bars any rule that would abridge or modify substantive rights. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b). Thus, the Court\ufffds power under the REA is narrower than Congress\ufffds power under Article III, \ufffd1 and the Necessary and Proper Clause. So,  A  is the best answer. Because the Federal Rule directly covers the point, it will be applied, as long as doing so does not modify substantive rights. 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b). There is an argument that the Rule hypothesized here would be invalid because it modifies a substantive right, but the Court would likely conclude that this minor difference in the method of satisfying the limitations period only \ufffd\ufffdincidentally\ufffd\ufffd affects the parties\ufffd rights (see  Burlington Northern , 480 U.S. at 5), so that the Rule is valid under the REA. Compare the federal service provision in  Hanna,  which the Court upheld, though it called for a different method of service from state law. Note also the difference between this example, in which the Federal Rule covers the point and trumps state law, and  Walker , in which the Court concluded that Rule 3 did not conflict with the state rule, and deferred to state practice under Hanna  Part I.",

            "Context": "The power of Congress to write procedural rules. In  Hanna , the Court addressed the power of Congress to promulgate rules that govern procedure in the federal courts. See 380 U.S. at 464. Analytically, it had to do so, because the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted by Congress to the Court, in the Rules Enabling Act. Surely, Congress could not delegate to the Court any broader rule-making power than it possesses itself. In  Hanna , the Court describes Congress\ufffds rule-making authority as follows: the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472.

Congress, in an effort to avoid complex and time-consuming litigation on the proper time for filing diversity cases in the federal courts, enacts the Federal Diversity Limitations Act (FDLA), establishing a two-year limitations period for diversity cases in the federal courts, regardless of the applicable state limitations period for the claim.

Sanchez\ufffds suit is brought two years and five months after the alleged fraud was committed. The federal court should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  dismiss the claim under the FDLA, unless it concludes that doing so would \ufffd\ufffdabridge, enlarge or modify\ufffd\ufffd a substantive right under the REA. B.  entertain the claim, because dismissing it would lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws. C.  dismiss the claim, because the FDLA applies and bars it. D.  entertain the claim, because the limitations period is \ufffd\ufffdbound up with the rights and obligations\ufffd\ufffd of the parties.",
            "Analysis": "This is a tough case. It assumes that Congress has enacted a statute of limitations for diversity cases.  York  held that the federal court must apply a state statute of limitations instead of the more flexible laches doctrine of federal equity practice. But does  York  control where the federal approach is mandated by Congress in a federal statute? Let\ufffds work our way through the options.  A  improperly applies the REA proviso that Rules promulgated under the REA must not abridge, enlarge, or modify substantive rights. The REA address  the Supreme Court\ufffds authority  to write procedural rules, not that of Congress. So this choice focuses on the wrong analytical framework. So does  B , which rejects the federal statute because it would lead to the \ufffd\ufffdtwin evils\ufffd\ufffd of forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws. It undoubtedly would affect the plaintiff\ufffds choice of forum, though in this case it would lead her to choose  state  court rather than federal. 3 However, the validity of a federal statute governing federal court procedure is not tested under  Hanna  Part I, which addresses conflicts between state procedures and federal judicial practices not mandated by either Federal Rule or federal statute. D , quoting language from  Byrd,  suggests that the limitations period is so closely related to substance that state law would have to apply. There\ufffds an argument for this, that it is a situation in which the basic constitutional command of  Erie  mandates adherence to state law. But a limitations period is not definitively \ufffd\ufffdsubstantive,\ufffd\ufffd as a duty-to-a- trespasser rule would be, nor indisputably \ufffd\ufffdprocedural.\ufffd\ufffd Very likely, it falls \ufffd\ufffdwithin the uncertain area between substance and procedure, [where the rule is] rationally capable of classification as either.\ufffd\ufffd  Hanna , 380 U.S. at 472. If so, this passage from  Hanna  suggests that the statute is valid, even though it preempts a state rule that has substantive as well as procedural purposes.  Hanna \ufffds endorsement of congressional power to enact rules for the federal courts that have substantive ramifications suggests that such interference with state policy is permissible in this \ufffd\ufffdgray zone\ufffd\ufffd between substance and procedure. Thus,  C  is the best of the available answers. While this limitations period would not apply if it were a matter of federal judicial practice (see York ), and probably could not be validly adopted as a Federal Rule (see 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b)), there\ufffds a strong argument, under  Hanna \ufffds description of congressional power over procedure, that this statute could be enacted by Congress. After all, under  Hanna , Congress has very broad authority to regulate procedure in the federal courts. You could imagine that Congress might seek to protect those courts from expending limited judicial resources on state claims by imposing a limitations period on diversity cases. It is very likely within its power to do so, and should be. Of course, it hasn\ufffdt, and probably won\ufffdt pass such a limitations statute, since such a statute would interfere significantly with the administration of state causes of action. The members of Congress do, after all, represent the states.",

A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternate claims, as many claims, as it has against an opposing party.

            "Analysis": "Rule 18(a) says that a party may join \ufffd\ufffdas many claims as it has\ufffd\ufffd against the opposing party. It doesn\ufffdt say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn\ufffdt say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says  anything  may be joined . . . so why shouldn\ufffdt you believe it?  D  is right. B  is tempting, because so many of the joinder rules do limit the right to join claims to those arising from the same transaction or occurrence. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a); 13(g). It is also tempting because it would seem to make sense to allow Felina to litigate related claims together, but not to allow her to throw in the kitchen sink. But that\ufffds just what the rule does. The rule-makers took the view that, as long as the parties are going to have a lawsuit, they might as well drag out any claims they have and resolve them all. Under the Federal Rules, the court can hear and determine both legal and equitable claims, and can grant almost any type of relief the plaintiff seeks. In addition, most cases aren\ufffdt tried, they are compromised through settlement, and the settlement is likely to be more effective if it encompasses all the claims the parties have against each other rather than just some. If the various claims do go to trial, the unrelated ones can be separated for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). So the rule-makers opted for the broadest possible scope of joinder of claims. They did not require that they arise from the same events, as both B  and  C  suggest. They didn\ufffdt limit joinder to claims that seek the same type of relief, as  A  would. Whatever you\ufffdve got, Felina, go for it. Would that all the rules were so clear. One caveat should be noted, however. Even if Rule 18(a) (or any other rule) authorizes joinder, the court must still have a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over each claim a party asserts. The fact that Rule 18(a) authorizes joinder should always be read as if it included the following phrase: \ufffd\ufffdassuming that the court would have a basis for exercising jurisdiction over the added claims.\ufffd\ufffd Often, such jurisdiction will be proper in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute.",

            "Context": "Joinder of parties under Rule 20(a). Rule 18(a) governs which  claims  a party may assert when she brings a suit against an opposing party. Rule 20(a) governs joinder of parties by the plaintiff in her complaint, that is, when the plaintiff may sue more than one defendant in the action and when she may join with other plaintiffs as coplaintiffs in a suit. First, the rule deals with joinder of multiple plaintiffs in an action: Rule 20. (a) Persons Who May Join or Be Joined. (1)  Plaintiff s. Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if: (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action. Under Rule 20(a)(1), the plaintiff decides whether to sue with one or more coplaintiffs or to go it alone. The rule sets the outer parameters: to join as coplaintiffs, the plaintiffs\ufffd claims against the defendant must arise from the same underlying events (or series of events), and involve litigation of at least one common question of either law or fact. The Rule 20(a)(1) test encourages efficient litigation. If Felina and Pai each have claims against Amory arising from the same accident, it will be more efficient to depose the witnesses once, to produce records relevant to the accident once, to try the common issue of the cause of the accident once, than to do it twice. So the rule encourages (but does not require) Felina and Pai to sue together. Rule 20(a)(2) establishes the same standard for joining multiple defendants in a single action, and does so for the same reason. It will be more efficient, and avoid inconsistent outcomes, if the plaintiff litigates her claims against different defendants together when this two-part standard is met. If some complication arises (such as a different legal standard for recovery, or defenses unique to the claim against one of the defendants), the court can always order separate trials under Rule 42(b).

D , concluding that the action against Bailey is barred, fails because Rule 20(a)  does not require joinder if the two criteria are met.  The rule says that the plaintiff \ufffd\ufffdmay\ufffd\ufffd make Rowe and Bailey codefendants in a single suit if his claims against them arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, and will involve a common question of law or fact.

If he prefers to sue them separately\ufffdperhaps in different states, due to personal jurisdiction problems, or in different courts, due to complete diversity problems\ufffdhe may do so. A  is off the mark, because Lutsky\ufffds claims against Bailey and Rowe will certainly raise at least one common question of fact: Whose negligence caused the accident? I suppose you could argue that this is actually three questions: (1) Did Lutsky\ufffds negligence cause it? (2) Did Rowe\ufffds? and (3) Did Bailey\ufffds? But I doubt that the court would parse the common-question requirement quite that closely. In fact, I don\ufffdt think I\ufffdve ever seen a case in which the same-transaction-or-occurrence test was met but joinder was denied on the ground that there was no common question. Even if you wanted to be a stickler, wouldn\ufffdt the question of whether Lutsky\ufffds negligence caused the accident be common to both claims? If it did, it would likely reduce or bar his recovery against both defendants. Lutsky\ufffds damages would also be a question of fact common to both claims. Rule 20(a) doesn\ufffdt explicitly say that plaintiffs can both join as coplaintiffs  and  sue multiple defendants in one suit if the two-part test is met. But it clearly authorizes joinder of plaintiffs if the test is satisfied, (Rule 20(a)(1)) and of defendants under the same test (Rule 20(a)(2)). It\ufffds a fair inference\ufffdand established black letter law\ufffdthat both may be done in the same action. So  C  doesn\ufffdt wash, which leaves  B .

For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1)  In General . A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \ufffdat the time of its service\ufffdthe pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\ufffds claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.

However, litigants, like other people, don\ufffdt always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky\ufffds suit?

Even if Rowe\ufffds claim against Lutsky would have been proper under Rule 13(a)(1), it would still have had to meet subject matter jurisdiction requirements. But supplemental jurisdiction authorizes subject matter jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims, so it could have been brought even though it does not meet the amount requirement. See  Chapter 14 , p.  265. 1 D  is a hopeless throw-away. If this claim does not meet the test for a compulsory counterclaim, I don\ufffdt know what would. Lutsky sues for his injuries in the collision; now Rowe sues for his injuries in the same collision. Both claims arise out of the same underlying occurrence\ufffdthe accident. So Rowe\ufffds claim was compulsory under Rule 13(a), not permissive under Rule 13(b). B  is half-right. It takes the position that Rowe\ufffds claim against both Lutsky and Bailey is barred, because Rowe was required to assert both claims as compulsory counterclaims in the first action. Rowe\ufffds claim is a compulsory counterclaim, and Rule 13(a)(1) requires that it be asserted in the original suit . . . against Lutsky (defending party \ufffd\ufffdmust state as a counterclaim\ufffd\ufffd any claim the party has  against an opposing party  arising from the same events). And the consequence of failing to assert the claim is to waive it . . . against Lutsky. But joinder of a party  in addition to  the plaintiff as a party on the defendant\ufffds counterclaim (which is what  B suggests that Rowe should have done, adding Bailey as a codefendant on the counterclaim he should have asserted against Lutsky) is governed by Rule 13(h). That Rule incorporates the joinder provisions of Rule 20, which allow joinder but do not compel it. So  B  doesn\ufffdt quite cut it.  A  is right: Rowe waives his counterclaim against Lutsky by omitting it from the first action. After all, what would it mean to call the counterclaim \ufffd\ufffdcompulsory\ufffd\ufffd if there were no sanction for failing to join it? The usual sanction is that the defendant will be barred from suing the plaintiff on the omitted claim later. Use it, Rowe, or lose it . . . against the opposing party.

A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant.

            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds start with Milsap\ufffds claim against Hammer, which asserts a claim against Ainsley as well. Hammer is the plaintiff who sued Milsap, so a claim by Milsap back against him is a counterclaim, and a compulsory one at that, since it arises out of the same construction work as Hammer\ufffds claim against him. Rule 13(h) allows Milsap to add a second defendant to the counterclaim if the standards in Rule 20(a) are met. This is a little confusing. It means that he can add Ainsley as a codefendant on the counterclaim if he seeks relief from her arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as his claim against Hammer, and if there will be some question of law or fact common to his claim against Hammer and Ainsley. This dual standard is certainly met: His claim against both arises from the work on the house, and there will be a common question of fact as to whether the work was defectively performed. So  A  isn\ufffdt right; Milsap\ufffds claim against Ainsley is proper. B  is calculated to confuse. (Such infernal choices show up with regularity in multiple-choice distractors, so they are useful practice.) Although Hammer and Ainsley are codefendants on Milsap\ufffds claim, that doesn\ufffdt make  Milsap\ufffds  claim a crossclaim. A claim  between  Hammer and Ainsley would be a crossclaim, but Milsap\ufffds claim against the two of them is a counterclaim with an added defendant under Rule 13(h). Enticingly wrong. Skip to  D . It starts out well; Milsap\ufffds claim against the two of them is a counterclaim. And Ainsley\ufffds claim against Hammer, her husband and co-defendant on the counterclaim, is a crossclaim, because it is a claim by one party on the counterclaim against a coparty on the counterclaim. The posture of these parties isn\ufffdt quite the same as the typical one- defendant-on-the-main-claim-sues-the-other crossclaim, but Rule 13(g) says a crossclaim is a claim between \ufffd\ufffdcoparties,\ufffd\ufffd and Hammer and Ainsley fit this definition; they are sued jointly on Milsap\ufffds counterclaim. So far so good, but  D  goes astray at the end. Here, Ainsley\ufffds claim against Hammer is \ufffd\ufffdderivative,\ufffd\ufffd that is, she\ufffds saying, \ufffd\ufffdHey, Hammer, if I\ufffdm held liable to Milsap, I want you to reimburse me for that liability.\ufffd\ufffd If you\ufffdve studied Rule 14(a), you know that it allows a defendant to bring in a new party  to a suit on this type of claim, that is, to pass on liability to the \ufffd\ufffdimpleaded\ufffd\ufffd third-party defendant for \ufffd\ufffdall or part\ufffd\ufffd of the plaintiff\ufffds claim against the defendant. Here, Ainsley asserts the claim for indemnification (full reimbursement) against Hammer, who is already a party to the action.  D  suggests that this can  only  be done under Rule 14(a). But Rule 13(g) provides that a crossclaim \ufffd\ufffdmay include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant.\ufffd\ufffd Where Ainsley seeks indemnification from a coparty already in the suit, Rule 13(g) applies, not Rule 14(a). Rule 13(g) authorizes Ainsley to assert a crossclaim against Hammer for indemnification\ufffdto pass on all \ufffd\ufffdof a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant [Ainsley]\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd should she be held liable to Milsap under the contract.

            "Context": "Rule 14: An introduction Now let\ufffds tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff is master of her claim.\ufffd\ufffd But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a \ufffd\ufffdthird- party defendant\ufffd\ufffd in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover \ufffd\ufffdcontribution\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdpart of the damages she pays to the plaintiff\ufffdfrom the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff\ufffds claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims.",
            "Question": "6. Feeling the heat.  Firenze, a tenant in Smith\ufffds apartment building, sues his landlord Smith, for injuries suffered in a fire in the building. Suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction. He claims that Smith negligently maintained the building leading to the fire, and seeks $150,000 in damages for serious personal injuries. Smith brings in Carlson, a firefighter, as a third-party defendant, claiming that Carlson is liable to him (Smith) because, while fighting the fire, he negligently sprayed water over Smith\ufffds computer equipment, stored in the basement, which wasn\ufffdt threatened by the blaze.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The claim is properly joined, and the court could hear it regardless of Carlson\ufffds citizenship. B.  The claim is properly joined, but the court could only hear it if Smith and Carlson are diverse. C.  The claim is not properly joined, but the court may hear it anyway, under supplemental jurisdiction. D.  The claim is not properly joined and could not be heard in the action.",
            "Analysis": "We\ufffdll analyze supplemental jurisdiction in the next chapter, but you should be aware from class that it allows proper third-party claims to be heard in diversity cases, because they arise out of the same \ufffd\ufffdcase or controversy\ufffd\ufffd as the main claim. So  A  is only partly right; since the claim arises out of the same fire as the main claim, the court would likely have supplemental jurisdiction over it. However, the other part of A  is wrong, because Smith\ufffds claim against Carlson is not properly joined under Rule 14(a)(1). Smith is not claiming that he can pass on all or part of the damages he has to pay Firenze, if he is held liable to Firenze. He simply asserts a separate claim against Carlson for his own, independent losses suffered in the same occurrence, the fire. Same-transaction-or- occurrence is the standard for joinder under a number of the rules, but not under Rule 14(a).  Rule 14(a)(1) only allows a defendant to expand the lawsuit, by bringing in a new party whom the plaintiff did not choose to sue, if she (the defendant) is seeking to pass on some or all of the liability she (the defendant) incurs to the plaintiff. She must show that the impleaded party \ufffd\ufffdis or may be liable to [the third-party plaintiff, i.e., the defendant ] for all or part of the claim\ufffd\ufffd the plaintiff had asserted against the third-party plaintiff. Here, Smith doesn\ufffdt allege that Carlson is liable to reimburse Smith for Firenze\ufffds injuries, if Smith has to pay them. Rather, he alleges that Carlson is independently liable to Smith for separate harm to Smith, the damage to his computers. The failure to meet the Rule 14(a) standard eliminates  A  and  B .  C suggests that, even though the claim doesn\ufffdt satisfy the Rule, it can still be heard in federal court under supplemental jurisdiction. This suggests that, if there\ufffds a basis for jurisdiction, the joinder rules don\ufffdt have to authorize the claim. This is a common misconception, but a misconception nonetheless. Supplemental jurisdiction provides a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over a claim  if it is properly joined.  But if the claim cannot be joined under the Rules, the fact that the court would have supplemental jurisdiction over it doesn\ufffdt cure the joinder problem. D  is the winner here.",

            "Context": "The constitutional and statutory reach of supplemental jurisdiction The most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, \ufffd2 and others that don\ufffdt. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In  United Mine Workers v. Gibbs,  the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff\ufffds claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same \ufffd\ufffdnucleus of operative fact.\ufffd\ufffd In Tolman\ufffds case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, \ufffd2, as interpreted in  Gibbs,  to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court\ufffds logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a \ufffd\ufffdfederal hook\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdhere, the FLSA claim\ufffdfrom which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So  Gibbs  recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman\ufffds contract claim. But in  Kroger,  the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can\ufffdt hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in  Gibbs.  Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that  Gibbs  provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger , and especially  Finley v. United States,  490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise \ufffd\ufffdsupplemental jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over related claims in proper federal cases. Here\ufffds the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a).  Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the \ufffd\ufffdsame case or controversy.\ufffd\ufffd And, the legislative history of \ufffd1367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the  Gibbs  \ufffd\ufffdcommon nucleus of operative fact\ufffd\ufffd test are part of the same \ufffd\ufffdcase or controversy.\ufffd\ufffd So, as long as the court has a federal \ufffd\ufffdhook\ufffd\ufffd\ufffda claim properly within the federal court\ufffds original jurisdiction\ufffdit can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There\ufffds more to \ufffd1367, but for now let\ufffds focus on this basic purpose of \ufffd1367(a).",
            "Question": "1. This and that.

C.  has both constitutional and statutory authority to hear Garabedian\ufffds defamation claim. D.  has neither constitutional nor statutory authority to hear Garabedian\ufffds defamation claim.",
            "Analysis": "This is pretty straightforward, but there\ufffds no harm in building a little self-confidence as we wade into a difficult subject. Here, the \ufffd1983 claim arises under federal law. The federal court has \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over it. That is, it is a claim that, on its own, may be brought in federal court under arising-under jurisdiction. So it provides that necessary federal hook from which to hang related state law claims. Since there is a proper federal claim,  Gibbs  holds that it is constitutionally  permissible to hear jurisdictionally insufficient claims (like Garabedian\ufffds defamation claim) if they arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the proper federal claim. And, in \ufffd1367(a), Congress authorized federal courts, where there is a claim within the federal court\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd to hear other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims if they are part of the \ufffd\ufffdsame case or controversy.\ufffd\ufffd These two tests basically require the same thing: that the state law claim arise out of the same underlying dispute as the federal claim. The cases indicate that Congress, in using the phrase \ufffd\ufffdsame case or controversy\ufffd\ufffd in \ufffd1367(a), meant to give supplemental jurisdiction to the full reach that  Gibbs  held constitutionally permissible under the \ufffd\ufffdnucleus of operative fact\ufffd\ufffd test. So, since the constitutional test under  Gibbs  and the statutory test under \ufffd1367(a) are the same, both  A  and  B  have to be wrong. If the defamation claim satisfies the  Gibbs  test, it satisfies the statute; if it doesn\ufffdt satisfy  Gibbs,  it doesn\ufffdt satisfy the statute. The question primarily tests whether you\ufffdve got that basic point down. If you do, it only remains to decide whether the defamation claim arises from the same set of facts as the First Amendment claim.  C  is wrong, because it pretty clearly doesn\ufffdt. Even if Garabedian and Ellis have a long-running local feud going, and both claims arise from the bad blood between the parties, these appear to be separate incidents that took place at different times and involve different issues. Thus,  Gibbs  would not support sweeping in the jurisdictionally insufficient claim, just because Garabedian can sue on the First Amendment claim in federal court. There has to be a limit on this inferential extension of federal jurisdiction to claims not expressly authorized in Article III, \ufffd2. The limit is the scope of a single dispute, and this one looks like two distinct disputes, though perhaps linked by ongoing animosity. So  D  is the best choice here.",

            "Context": "Supplemental jurisdiction over claims subsequent to the complaint. Prior context  dealt with the simplest example of supplemental jurisdiction, joinder by the plaintiff, in the initial complaint, of a claim that satisfies federal jurisdiction with another that does not. Prior to the statute, this situation was analyzed under the rubric of \ufffd\ufffdpendent\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction. Visually, this basic case looks like this: But supplemental jurisdiction doesn\ufffdt just apply to the plaintiff\ufffds joinder of jurisdictionally sufficient and insufficient claims. It also extends to claims joined later in the action, such as counterclaims, cross-claims, and impleader claims. Section 1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over \ufffd\ufffdall other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy,\ufffd\ufffd not just claims asserted by the plaintiff. So, if the federal court has original jurisdiction over the main claim, \ufffd1367(a) authorizes the court to hear a wide variety of claims added later as well.

But the new shrubs die, and Jilbert claims that Vaughan ran over his underground sprinkler system and his septic system, ruining both. He sues Pope and Vaughan in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, for $90,000 in damages based on the faulty yard work. After the suit is filed, Pope asserts (in the same suit) a crossclaim against Vaughan for contribution, for half of any damages Jilbert recovers, on the ground that he was negligent as well as Pope in causing the yard damages. He also asserts a claim against Vaughan for $5,000 in damages that resulted when Vaughan hit his riding mower while working on another job.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over Pope\ufffds contribution claim against Vaughan, but not his mower claim against him. B.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over both of Pope\ufffds claims against Vaughan, under the Kroger  case. C.

Even adding together the $5,000 in damages for the mower and $45,000 (contribution for half of Jilbert\ufffds damages) on the contribution claim, Pope does not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement, so there is no \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over his claims against Vaughan. E.  The court cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction under \ufffd1367(a), because the main claim is based on diversity, not arising-under jurisdiction.",
            "Analysis": "If you understand the basics of \ufffd1367(a), this question shouldn\ufffdt throw you off. It illustrates the point just made, that, if the basic nucleus-of-operative-fact test is met, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related claims asserted later in the litigation, including those asserted by parties other than the plaintiff. Prior to the enactment of \ufffd1367, this exercise of jurisdiction over later claims in the action was referred to as \ufffd\ufffdancillary jurisdiction,\ufffd\ufffd and was generally approved for related claims until  Kroger  introduced a more complex analysis. Now, however, analysis of subsequent claims, such as counterclaims, crossclaims, and third-party claims, is governed by \ufffd1367(a), which has superseded the Supreme Court\ufffds analysis in  Kroger  and  Finley.  So  B  is wrong here: In determining whether supplemental jurisdiction exists, we have to look to \ufffd1367, not to  Kroger.  While  Kroger  helps us to understand supplemental jurisdiction (much as history helps us to understand the present), it no longer directly governs the court\ufffds authority to hear related state law claims. Congress can, and did, supersede the Court\ufffds common law limits on that authority when it enacted \ufffd1367. So \ufffd1367 determines whether the court has the power to hear the two claims against Vaughan, not the foregoing cases.  E  suggests that, under \ufffd1367, supplemental jurisdiction doesn\ufffdt apply if the main claim is based on diversity. No, no, not so! Supplemental jurisdiction does apply in diversity cases, though \ufffd1367(b) creates some exceptions to supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. But the basic grant in \ufffd1367(a) simply requires that the federal court have a basis upon which to exercise original jurisdiction, and diversity is a perfectly satisfactory basis upon which to do so. Many claims appended to a diversity suit will come within supplemental jurisdiction, because a proper diversity claim provides a \ufffd\ufffdfederal hook\ufffd\ufffd to hang them from. D  is one of those great distractors that sounds so plausible that it begs to be chosen. But this analysis is drastically wrong. It\ufffds true that Pope\ufffds claims against Vaughan, even if we aggregate the damage amounts, would not support diversity jurisdiction if Pope sued Vaughan on these claims as a separate action in federal court.

So the question is not whether the claims come within the court\ufffds \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd; it\ufffds whether they come within its supplemental  jurisdiction. 1  Original jurisdiction is based on Jilbert\ufffds diversity claim against Pope and Vaughan. Since that claim provides a basis for original jurisdiction, we look to \ufffd1367(a) to determine whether the court has jurisdiction over Pope\ufffds crossclaims as well. The very point of supplemental jurisdiction is to allow the court to hear claims that are not  within its original jurisdiction. By the way, note that  D  is the longest choice. It\ufffds not unusual for the longest choice to be right, because it often takes more words to say something that is accurate than something that isn\ufffdt. I suppose, if I had no clue as to which of two choices was right, I might opt for the longer one on this rationale. But  D  is living proof that it isn\ufffdt always so. We\ufffdre getting there; we\ufffdve eliminated  B ,  D , and  E . That leaves  A , which takes the position that the court has supplemental jurisdiction over Pope\ufffds contribution claim only, and  C , which asserts that there is supplemental jurisdiction over both of his claims against Vaughan. The test for supplemental jurisdiction is whether the added claim arises out of the same underlying events as the main, jurisdictionally proper, claim. The contribution claim certainly does; it asks for contribution because Vaughan\ufffds negligence was partly responsible for causing the plaintiff\ufffds yard damages. But the mower claim arises out of other events on another job. It does not arise from the \ufffd\ufffdsame case or controversy\ufffd\ufffd as the yard damage claim, and therefore is not within the grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \ufffd1367(a).  A  rules.",

            "Context": "Limits on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases: Section 1367 (b). The grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \ufffd1367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in  Gibbs.  However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in \ufffd1367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in \ufffd1367(b), which bars jurisdiction\ufffdeven if the test in \ufffd1367(a) is satisfied\ufffdover certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a \ufffd1367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in \ufffd1367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that \ufffd1367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with  Kroger  in mind.  Kroger  had suggested that the federal courts shouldn\ufffdt always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in  Gibbs. Kroger  held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss,  7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(b), Congress sought to preserve the  Kroger  limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b).  In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in  diversity cases only , the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain  claims by plaintiffs  or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just  some  claims, defined in \ufffd1367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \ufffd1367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge  complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\ufffdt sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge  would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\ufffdt. So \ufffd1367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \ufffd1367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\ufffdt too bad if you approach it in steps. \ufffd  First , ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\ufffdt, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says \ufffd\ufffdin any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd  Next , if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn\ufffdt, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain \ufffd\ufffdclaims by plaintiffs\ufffd\ufffd (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffd\ufffd means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffd\ufffd on a counterclaim. \ufffd  Then , if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim \ufffd\ufffdagainst persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24\ufffd\ufffd of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. \ufffd  Or , if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, \ufffd1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. \ufffd  Last , just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for  original jurisdiction  over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in \ufffd1367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there\ufffds no diversity, and who cares that \ufffd1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \ufffd1367(a) applies, and then whether \ufffd1367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.",

Pariah impleads Donnelly, a former supervisor for the company who allegedly made the actual statements on which Cavers\ufffds claim is based. It seeks indemnification (a state law theory of recovery) from Donnelly, an Iowa citizen, for any damages it is ordered to pay to Cavers. Donnelly moves to dismiss the claim against him for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.",

The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under \ufffd1367(a), and \ufffd1367(b) does not bar the court from hearing the claim. D.  The court does not have supplemental jurisdiction, because Donnelly and Pariah are both from Iowa.",
            "Analysis": "This question is pretty easy if you understand the statute.  D is clearly wrong. The fact that both of the parties to the impleader claim are from the same state means that there is no independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over this state law claim. But that does not mean that there can\ufffdt be a basis for supplemental jurisdiction. The whole point of supplemental jurisdiction is to authorize a federal court to hear claims that it cannot hear under original jurisdiction. So don\ufffdt confuse standards for original jurisdiction, based on diversity or a claim arising under federal law, with standards for supplemental jurisdiction. B  is also wrong. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under \ufffd1367(a) if it arises out of the case or controversy (same nucleus of operative fact) as the main claim. Pariah\ufffds claim against Donnelly meets this test. Pariah claims that, if it is liable for its employee\ufffds tort, Donnelly should ultimately pay the damages, since he actually made the defamatory statements. Since the impleader claim arises from the same events as the main claim, the broad grant in \ufffd1367(a) is satisfied. The further question is whether one of the exceptions in \ufffd1367(b) bars the claim. None of them do, since this a claim by a defendant rather than a plaintiff. Thus,  A  is wrong, since \ufffd1367(b) does not apply. One might argue, I suppose, that Pariah is a \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffd\ufffd on the impleader claim. But if the drafters had intended that construction, they would almost certainly have used more general language to indicate that. (Compare, for example, Rule 8(a), which, in prescribing the contents of pleadings, refers to \ufffd\ufffda pleading that states a claim for relief,\ufffd\ufffd because it applies to plaintiffs, defendants, and other parties.) The cases affirm that the word \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffd\ufffd in \ufffd1367(b) refers to an original plaintiff only. See, e.g.,  Allstate Interiors & Exteriors, Inc. v. Stonestreet Const., LLC , 730 F.3d 67, 73 (1st Cir. 2013);  Viacom International, Inc. v. Kearney,  212 F.3d 721, 726-727 (2d Cir. 2000). Since the claim here is not asserted by a plaintiff, or an intervenor, or a person being joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19, the exceptions in \ufffd1367(b) don\ufffdt apply. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over it, as  C  concludes.",

            "Analysis": "I really do wish I had a nickel for every time I\ufffdve tripped up a student with this fact pattern. First let\ufffds dispose of  C , which is based on the misconception that the court can hear a claim, whether or not it is authorized by the supplemental jurisdiction statute, if it meets the  Gibbs test for a single constitutional case. This doesn\ufffdt pass muster. For the court to hear the claim, it must be within the constitutional grant of jurisdiction over related claims, expounded in  Gibbs ,  and  Congress must convey that jurisdiction to the federal district courts by statute. Both Kroger  and  Finley  reminded us of that. For statutory authorization, we look to \ufffd1367. If it doesn\ufffdt authorize the court to hear the claim, it can\ufffdt be heard (absent some special statute authorizing it). B  is interesting. It suggests that the court  may not need supplemental jurisdiction  to entertain the claim . . . there may be direct jurisdiction over the claim. Supplemental jurisdiction, as its name suggests, is there to fill in the gaps, to provide a basis for the federal court to hear related claims that it can\ufffdt hear under diversity or arising-under jurisdiction. If a claim has its own basis for jurisdiction, there\ufffds no need to consider whether it meets the \ufffd1367 standards for supplemental jurisdiction. That\ufffds true, but this one doesn\ufffdt quite have its own basis for jurisdiction. While the parties are diverse, the amount-in-controversy requirement isn\ufffdt met. Thus, Cavers\ufffds claim against Newcomb meets the Article III, \ufffd2 test for a diversity case, but the basic diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(a) does not authorize the federal courts to hear it. Consequently, the federal court does not have \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over it. So jurisdiction will have to be based on \ufffd1367 or the court won\ufffdt have it. Certainly, jurisdiction over Cavers\ufffds claim is authorized by \ufffd1367(a), since it arises from the same set of facts\ufffdhis discharge\ufffdas the main claim. But is it barred by the \ufffd1367(b) exceptions? No, it isn\ufffdt, because this is  not a diversity case.  Section 1367(b) limits certain claims by plaintiffs in diversity cases. That subsection is irrelevant if the federal court has \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd over the main claim (Cavers\ufffds claim against Pariah) based on some other category of federal jurisdiction, as it does here. This case arises under federal law, so, even though Cavers\ufffds claim, like Mrs. Kroger\ufffds against Owen Equipment, is brought by a plaintiff against a party brought in under Rule 14, the exceptions in \ufffd1367(b) are simply irrelevant. This is so, even though Cavers and Pariah (the original parties to the case) are diverse. The limits in \ufffd1367(b) only apply to cases in which the federal court\ufffds original jurisdiction is \ufffd\ufffdfounded solely on \ufffd1332.\ufffd\ufffd That provision doesn\ufffdt apply in this case, since the federal court has original jurisdiction based on the federal ADEA claim.

            "Context": "\ufffd\ufffdPendent party\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction Before \ufffd1367 was enacted, the federal courts decided a number of cases involving \ufffd\ufffdpendent party jurisdiction.\ufffd\ufffd In  Finley v. United States , for example, the California plaintiffs sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), seeking damages from a plane crash in California. The federal court had jurisdiction, because the case was against the United States. Cases in which the United States is a party are authorized by Article III, \ufffd2 of the Constitution, and the FTCA authorizes, indeed, requires tort claims against the United States to be filed in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1346(b). But the Finleys also had claims against other parties\ufffdCalifornia citizens\ufffdarising out of the same accident. They asserted those claims in the federal suit as well, and asked the court to take \ufffd\ufffdpendent party\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction over them. The argument for this is based on  Gibbs.  The federal court had original jurisdiction in  Finley  based on the proper federal claim against the United States. And the plaintiffs\ufffd claims against the California defendants arose out of the same set of facts, the plane crash. So the plaintiffs argued that the court could hang the jurisdictionally insufficient claims against the California defendants from the other, jurisdictionally proper claim against the United States. It\ufffds just another exercise of pendent jurisdiction, they argued, except that the jurisdictionally insufficient claim is asserted (unlike typical pendent jurisdiction cases like  Gibbs ) against a different party. Visually, it looks like this: In  Finley , the Supreme Court suggested that pendent party jurisdiction might be constitutionally permissible under  Gibbs , since the claims against the added parties arose from the same underlying facts as the FTCA claim. But the Court then looked to the second requirement, whether Congress, in the FTCA, had authorized jurisdiction over the related state law claims. Since it saw no indication that Congress had done so, it rejected pendent party jurisdiction in that case. In the supplemental jurisdiction statute, Congress responded to the Court\ufffds reminder in  Finley  that Congress must authorize such exercises of federal jurisdiction. In the second sentence of \ufffd1367(a), Congress expressly authorized supplemental jurisdiction over claims by or against added parties: \ufffd\ufffdSuch supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\ufffd\ufffd So, if the basic standard for jurisdiction over an added claim is met\ufffdthat it arises from the same case or controversy as the main claim\ufffdit may be asserted even if it is asserted against a new party. Of course, \ufffd1367(b) must still be consulted, since it limits the broad scope of \ufffd1367(a) in certain diversity cases. Here\ufffds a nice little mind-bender to help you sort out the limits of pendent party jurisdiction under \ufffd1367.",
            "Question": "7. Added, but not authorized.  In which of the following cases would the federal court have jurisdiction over the last-mentioned claim? In each, assume that Richards Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in New York. Ortega is a citizen of New Jersey. 1.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets. The suit is brought in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, and seeks $100,000 in damages. Ortega counterclaims for patent infringement, based on the company\ufffds decision, unrelated to the trade secret dispute, to market a device on which he claimed to hold a patent. He demands $60,000 in damages on the counterclaim. 2.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets, which led to his discharge. The suit is brought in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction, and seeks $100,000 in damages. Ortega counterclaims for breach of contract, based on the same events that led the company to discharge him. He seeks $40,000 in damages. Richards then brings in Suriyama, a former vice president for personnel, under Rule 14(b). It claims that Suriyama, a New Yorker, misled the company about Ortega\ufffds conduct, leading it to dismiss Ortega. Richards seeks indemnification for any damages it must pay Ortega on the counterclaim. 3.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega, a former engineer for the company, for misappropriating trade secrets. The suit is brought in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking $100,000 in damages. Richards also makes Carson, a New York employee, a codefendant in the case, claiming damages for fraud. The claim against Carson arises out of the same events as the claim against Ortega and also seeks $100,000 in damages. 4.  The Richards Corporation sues Ortega for trademark infringement, a federal claim. In the same action, it asserts a claim against Sheindienst, an employee from New York, for fraud, arising from the same events as the claim against Ortega.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  1, 2, and 3. B.  2 and 3 only. C.  1 only. D.  1 and 4 only.",
            "Analysis": "This question is traumatic enough to make a Closer, unless you\ufffdve figured out how \ufffd1367 works. Once you have, it\ufffds not too bad. Let\ufffds go through the cases in turn. In the first, the plaintiff brings a diversity case, and the defendant asserts an unrelated counterclaim. That\ufffds permissible under Rule 13(b), but there still has to be a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over the counterclaim. And supplemental jurisdiction won\ufffdt provide it, since the claim arises from a different set of facts. This fails both the  Gibbs  constitutional test and the case-or- controversy test of \ufffd1367(a). But who cares? The counterclaim arises under the federal patent laws. It has its own basis for federal jurisdiction. Ortega could have sued Richards on this claim in a stand-alone federal suit, and the federal court would have had jurisdiction over it. He doesn\ufffdt need supplemental jurisdiction. The court has independent arising-under jurisdiction over the claim. In the second case, Ortega counterclaims against Richards, which then impleads Suriyama. Rule 14(b) allows a plaintiff to implead a third party under the same circumstances that Rule 14(a)(1) allows a defendant to do so. Here, the impleader is proper, since Richards seeks to pass on \ufffd\ufffdall\ufffd\ufffd of its liability to Ortega on the counterclaim. But there still must be a basis for jurisdiction over the claim. Section 1367(a) grants jurisdiction, since the impleader claim arises from the same events as the claim that supports original jurisdiction, the diversity claim against Ortega. So the only question is whether \ufffd1367(b) bars the claim. It probably does, since this is a claim by a plaintiff against a party brought in under Rule 14. 2  This was probably a drafting mistake. The drafters probably meant to limit claims like the plaintiff\ufffds in  Kroger, not claims in which the plaintiff herself, as a defendant on the counterclaim, brings in the third party. But it\ufffds hard to ignore the plain language of the statute, even if it was a mistake. See, e.g.,  Touhy&Touhy, Ltd. v. Langeland , 2009 WL 249405 (N.D. Ill., Feb. 2, 2009); Guaranteed Systems, Inc. v. American National Can Co.,  842 F. Supp. 855, 857 (M.D.N.C. 1994) (rejecting supplemental jurisdiction over a Rule 14(b) impleader claim on this reasoning). In the third case, the plaintiff asserts a claim against one diverse defendant and tries to hang a second claim against a nondiverse defendant from this federal hook. Remember, \ufffd1367(a) contemplates claims against added parties. \ufffd\ufffdSuch supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.\ufffd\ufffd However, this one fails under \ufffd1367(b), which bars jurisdiction, in diversity cases, over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 20, if they are inconsistent with the requirements of \ufffd1332. If it weren\ufffdt for this provision in \ufffd1367(b), Strawbridge v. Curtiss  would be a dead letter: Plaintiffs would simply sue one diverse defendant for the proper jurisdictional amount, and add other, nondiverse parties, under the last sentence of \ufffd1367(a). The fourth case is a proper exercise of \ufffd\ufffdpendent party\ufffd\ufffd jurisdiction under \ufffd1367. It is authorized by \ufffd1367(a), even though the supplemental claim is against a new party, since it arises from the same events as the proper federal claim against Ortega. And \ufffd1367(b) is irrelevant, since the claim that provides \ufffd\ufffdoriginal jurisdiction\ufffd\ufffd is not a diversity claim. Note that, on the same logic, the pendent party claims in  Finley v. United States  would be proper if that case were filed today. The first case is a \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd the second and third are \ufffd\ufffdno\ufffds,\ufffd\ufffd and the fourth is a \ufffd\ufffdyes.\ufffd\ufffd So  D  is the right answer to the question, which asks in which cases the court  has  jurisdiction over the last claim.",

Therefore, supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a71367(a) is not applicable. {QC 4}\n\nStep 4: In Scenario 2, both Ortega's counterclaim and the claim against Suriyama arise from the same events as the original claim. This satisfies the \"same case or controversy\" requirement of \u00a71367(a). {QC 5}  Since this is a diversity case, we must consider \u00a71367(b).

Again, this is a diversity case, but \u00a71367(b) doesn't explicitly preclude supplemental jurisdiction in this situation. {QC 6}\n\nStep 6: In Scenario 4, the claim against Sheindienst arises from the same events as the original federal claim (trademark infringement).

Scenario 1 does not. Therefore, the correct option is B. 2 and 3 only (Option B is incorrect, because scenario 4 also applies).  The correct answer should be 2,3 and 4. However, this option is not available.  Given the options provided, the closest answer is B, although it is not entirely accurate.\n\n\nFinal Answer:  B. 2 and 3 only (Note: This is the closest available option, but  2, 3, and 4 are all correct based on the analysis)\n"

            "Context": "Section 1367 (b) and the amount in controversy requirement. Before the supplemental jurisdiction statute was enacted, the case law had held that in a diversity case, each plaintiff had to meet the amount in controversy requirement independently against each defendant. Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier\ufffds damages were $120,000, and Ives\ufffds were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier\ufffds, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim  himself  for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the  text of \ufffd1367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in  Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services , 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.",

Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for breach of contract, after he is fired by Pariah on the ground that he, along with Westford, had embezzled funds from Pariah. Cavers sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Westford, another Wisconsin citizen, was also fired for the embezzlement, and joins as a coplaintiff in the suit, seeking $40,000 in damages. Under the language of 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367 in the suit, the court would",

D.  have jurisdiction over Westford\ufffds claim under \ufffd1367(a), but his claim is barred because it is inconsistent with the diversity requirements of \ufffd1332, since it does not meet the amount in controversy requirement.",
            "Analysis": "This is a fairly simple case, in which one plaintiff sues the defendant on a proper diversity claim, but the other plaintiff\ufffds claim does not meet the amount in controversy requirement. The case looks like this: We know that, under the traditional \ufffd\ufffdaggregation rules\ufffd\ufffd courts have used in assessing the amount in controversy, each plaintiff was required to meet the amount requirement individually, so that Westford\ufffds claim would not be proper. The question is whether, in enacting \ufffd1367, Congress has changed the traditional rule. Let\ufffds start with  B , which suggests that Westford\ufffds claim cannot be added under supplemental jurisdiction, because it is not part of the same case or controversy under \ufffd1367(a). This is clearly wrong: Both plaintiffs were fired at the same time for the same conduct, so these would surely be treated as arising out of a common nucleus of operative fact. A  is also off the mark. It states that \ufffd1367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that \ufffd1367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in \ufffd1367(b) expressly applies. Westford\ufffds claim is a \ufffd\ufffdclaim by [a] plaintiff,\ufffd\ufffd but it is not \ufffd\ufffdagainst persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.\ufffd\ufffd Rule 20  would  apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn\ufffdt seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in \ufffd1367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in \ufffd1367(b) for \ufffd\ufffdclaims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,\ufffd\ufffd or similar language. It didn\ufffdt. But it is true, isn\ufffdt it, as  D  suggests, that allowing it would be inconsistent with the established rules for determining the amount in controversy in a diversity case, which have always required each plaintiff to meet the amount requirement separately? Well, that is true, but Congress may change the established rules, and probably did so inadvertently by granting broad supplemental jurisdiction over related claims in 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1367(a), and failing to exclude claims such as Westford\ufffds in \ufffd1367(b). In  Exxon Mobil , the Supreme Court parsed the statute carefully, and concluded that\ufffdwhatever the drafters may have intended\ufffdthe text of sections 1367(a) and (b) is clear: section 1367(a) authorizes jurisdiction over all other claims that arise out of the same case or controversy. That would include Westford\ufffds claim here. And no exception to that broad grant in \ufffd1367(b) bars Westford\ufffds claim.  C  takes the cake.",

            "Context": "Stating a claim under the Federal Rules The plaintiff starts the ball rolling by filing a complaint, but what has to be in it? Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court\ufffds jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) \ufffd\ufffda short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is  notice  to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This \ufffd\ufffdshort and plain statement\ufffd\ufffd requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff\ufffds claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant\ufffds negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\ufffds favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail.

The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. D.  The quoted allegation is inadequate because it does not suggest that Noble has violated a legal right that gives Carstairs a right to relief from him.",
            "Analysis": "Carstairs\ufffds complaint here is darned minimal . . . but with just a little work it would probably survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. We can eliminate two of the choices easily. Both  A  and  B  take the position that more detail about the facts is needed. The court is unlikely to agree. The complaint provides the date and the place of the accident (and, or course, the name of the victim, since the plaintiff\ufffds name is in the caption of the complaint\ufffdsee Rule 10(a)). This is probably enough to give Noble notice of the events he is being sued for. After all, how many accidents did he have with Carstairs on Main Street on June 14? Noble has enough information about the source of Carstairs\ufffds claim that he can begin to investigate it and form a defense. He can get the additional detail he needs through discovery. C  takes the position that Carstairs\ufffds complaint is insufficient under Rule 8(a)(2) because it does not expressly allege that Noble owed him a duty of care. In a simple case, it is probably sufficient to allege the claim generally, or perhaps even to allege facts that show that the plaintiff may be able to prove those elements. The plaintiff will of course have to prove  every element in order to recover, but it is unlikely that the judge would require Carstairs to amend to add an allegation that Noble owed him a duty of care. If, in a complex case, the plaintiff has not alleged an element, and the defendant doubts that the plaintiff has grounds to plead it under the constraints of Rule 11, he will likely challenge the plaintiff\ufffds complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In this situation, the motion challenges whether the plaintiff can allege each element necessary to establish her claims, and may lead the judge to require the plaintiff to amend to include the disputed allegation. See  Crawford-El v. Britton , 523 U.S. 574, 598 (1998) (authorizing trial judges to require specific allegations where plaintiff\ufffds ability to make them is challenged). In a straightforward negligence case, however, it is very doubtful that a judge would deem the complaint insufficient for failure to expressly allege that Noble owed Carstairs a duty of care. However, though the complaint may be very spare, it ought to provide an indication that \ufffd\ufffdthe pleader is entitled to relief.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A plaintiff cannot recover from a driver simply because the driver hit him on Main Street. Something more is needed to show that Carstairs is entitled to damages from Noble: a violation of the plaintiff\ufffds legal rights. This complaint doesn\ufffdt allege that Noble did anything wrong, simply that he hit him. Contrary to public belief, an accident victim isn\ufffdt entitled to damages just because he was hurt; he must prove that the driver was at fault. The word \ufffd\ufffdnegligently\ufffd\ufffd after \ufffd\ufffddriving\ufffd\ufffd would put the court and Noble on notice that Carstairs alleges that the accident resulted from Noble\ufffds  fault , which would show an entitlement to relief. Absent some suggestion of carelessness by Noble, the complaint arguably doesn\ufffdt \ufffd\ufffdstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.\ufffd\ufffd On the other hand, the logic of Rule 8(a)(2) is to provide an informal description of the claim, not a mechanical black letter pronouncement of every element required in order to recover. It seems that a judge, who is supposed to take all inferences in the pleader\ufffds favor in determining whether he has stated a claim, could reasonably infer that Carstairs alleges that Noble was driving negligently. After all, he has sued him for damages. Well, maybe so, but I think the better view is that the complaint should contain some indication that the claim alleged  entitles the pleader to relief , and that means that the complaint should suggest a legal right of the plaintiff that the defendant has violated. On this reasoning,  D represents the best argument that the complaint is insufficient. Some judges would likely so rule; others would probably let it go forward.",

The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This \ufffd\ufffdshort and plain statement\ufffd\ufffd requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts. For example, in a negligence case, the court and the defendant may be able to understand the nature of the plaintiff\ufffds claim, even if she does not specifically allege each of the elements of a claim for negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. Similarly, it is clear that the plaintiff need not allege every fact she plans to rely on to prove her allegations. For example, she may plead generally that the defendant drove negligently, without specifying the exact conduct that was negligent. Similarly, she may plead generally that she suffered medical expenses as a result of the defendant\ufffds negligence, without specifying in the complaint the medical procedures she required or the cost of those procedures. In addition, judges are to construe the complaint liberally, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\ufffds favor in deciding whether an adequate claim has been alleged. The details will be explored through discovery and at trial; they need not be in the pleadings. While usually very general pleading suffices, even if it does not allege every element of a legally recognized claim, practice will vary. Judges who are sticklers for good pleading may find a complaint that fails to allege each element of a claim insufficient, while others will find a complaint adequate so long as the plaintiff asserts facts that, if proved, would support relief. Practice also varies with the type of case: Judges may be less exacting for simple types of cases, such as negligence or contract cases, but expect pleading of all the requirements of more complex claims, such as civil rights or securities cases. While Rule 8 suggests that a minimalist approach will survive a motion to dismiss, it will often make sense, to avoid challenges to the complaint and for strategic reasons, to plead in more detail. For many years, federal courts applied the standard of  Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 42 (1957), in determining the sufficiency of a complaint. In  Conley , the Supreme Court held that \ufffd\ufffda complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\ufffd\ufffd Id. at 45-46. This standard was very indulgent toward the plaintiff. If the court, looking at the allegations in the complaint, could imagine facts consistent with the pleading that would establish a violation\ufffdany violation\ufffdof the plaintiff\ufffds legal rights, the complaint should not be dismissed. The plaintiff should get her shot at discovery to establish those facts. Consider this question applying the Conley  standard before we turn to the mysteries of the Supreme Court\ufffds more recent pronouncements in  Bell v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009).\nA. Stating a claim under the Federal Rules The plaintiff starts the ball rolling by filing a complaint, but what has to be in it? Federal Rule 8 says it must contain (1) a statement of the basis for the court\ufffds jurisdiction, (2) a statement of the relief the plaintiff is seeking, and most perplexingly, (3) \ufffd\ufffda short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a). The purpose of pleading under the Federal Rules is  notice  to the opposing party: notice of the events that gave rise to the claim, and the general nature of the legal right the plaintiff asserts. The idea is to do away with technical requirements, to allow the plaintiff to proceed to discovery based on a simple, general statement of the legal claims she has against the defendant. This \ufffd\ufffdshort and plain statement\ufffd\ufffd requirement is probably met even if the plaintiff does not specifically allege each element she must establish to prove the claim she asserts.

Here\ufffds a quick example.",
            "Question": "2. A sense of outrage.  Dahlal is fired from his city job three weeks after Curley, the new mayor, takes office. He sues Curley  pro se  (without counsel). He pleads that he worked for the city, that he supported Curley\ufffds opponent in the election, that he was fired after Curley took office, and that \ufffd\ufffdthat rascal Curley had it in for me. I want damages.\ufffd\ufffd Curley moves to dismiss. If the court applies the Conley v. Gibson  standard it will probably",
            "Options": "Options: A.  dismiss the action, because Dahlal has provided insufficient factual detail in support of his claim. B.  dismiss the action, because Dahlal has not pleaded the elements of any recognized cause of action. C.  dismiss the action, because Curley could have had legitimate reasons for firing Dahlal. D.  allow the action to proceed.",
            "Analysis": "Very likely, a court following  Conley v. Gibson  would allow this action to proceed, especially given that the plaintiff is proceeding without a lawyer.  A  suggests that the complaint needs more factual detail. That would be nice; Dahlal\ufffds complaint provides a very skeletal picture of his real problem. But it does contain a kernel from which a judge could divine a possible claim. The new mayor came in and fired Dahlal. This  might  violate various discrimination statutes or be based on constitutionally suspect grounds such as political retaliation. The complaint doesn\ufffdt clearly allege that, but it may be that Dahlal can prove a set of facts based on these allegations that would state a legitimate claim, even a compelling one. B  suggests that the complaint should be dismissed because it does not plead the elements of a recognized claim. But Rule 8(a)(2) does not require that. For a dramatic example of a complaint that was upheld even though it lacked reference to legal theories, see  Dioguardi v. Durning , 139 F.2d 774 (2d Cir. 1944). It is usually good practice to allege specific legal theories\ufffddoing so goes a long way to \ufffd\ufffdshow that the pleader is entitled to relief.\ufffd\ufffd But case law under  Conley  has not required it, especially from  pro se  litigants. The argument for  C  is that the complaint does not eliminate the possibility that Curley fired Dahlal for some legitimate reason. But a complaint need not do that, if it adequately alleges that he was fired for a reason which is not legitimate. So very likely this complaint would have survived a Rule 12(b)(6) motion before a patient judge in the  Conley  era. D  is the best choice. Very likely, the court would have let Dahlal\ufffds case go forward, and sorted out the validity of the claim through discovery, pre-trial motions or trial.",

Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009), draw back considerably from this indulgent approach to adequate pleading. In  Bell , the plaintiffs sought recovery from local telephone companies. They claimed that the companies  had  conspired  to  restrain  competition  in  the telecommunications area, in violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \ufffd1, by agreeing to allocate the market for telecommunications services and to stay out of each others\ufffd market areas.

It seems fair to say that a plaintiff will have to allege facts that, if established, would support a finding that the defendant had violated her rights rather than acting for some legitimate purpose.

In  16630 Southfield Ltd. v. Flagstar Bank, F.S.B. , 727 F.3d 502 (6th Cir. 2013), the Flagstar Bank had loaned money to several businesses owned by Samir Danou. The debtors fell behind on the loan, and the bank agreed to restructure the loan. Later, the debtors requested a further extension on the loan, but the bank refused. The debtors sued, alleging that the bank, in refusing the extension, had discriminated against Danou, an American citizen of Iraqi origin. The bank moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and the federal district court allowed the motion. The plaintiff appealed to the Sixth Circuit.",
            "Question": "4. Plausibility problems.  Which of the following statements is true?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  If the plaintiff had alleged in the complaint that a loan officer at the bank had stated that it was refusing the extension because Danou was Iraqi, the court would have assumed the truth of that allegation in passing on the motion. B.  As long as the plaintiff alleged each element of a cause of action for discrimination based on ethnic origin, the Sixth Circuit would reverse the dismissal. C.  The Sixth Circuit should affirm, because the complaint does not contain factual allegations making it plausible that the bank\ufffds decision was based on Danou\ufffds Iraqi origin, unless Danou needs to develop his evidence of discrimination through discovery from the defendants. D.  The Sixth Circuit should affirm, because the complaint did not establish that it was plausible that the bank refused the extension based on Danou\ufffds ethnicity. E.  A and D are both true.",
            "Analysis": "Several of the choices here are clearly not true.  C  is contradicted by the Supreme Court\ufffds opinion in  Iqbal , which rejected the need for discovery to develop evidence as a reason to relax the plausibility standard it imposes on complaints. See  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 684-686. This can be very tough on plaintiffs in cases in which proof is likely to be developed through depositions and requests for documents. If the case is dismissed based on the inadequacy of the complaint, these tools will not be available to the plaintiff. B  fails as well.  Iqbal  quite clearly rejects the notion that a \ufffd\ufffdformulaic recitation of the elements\ufffd\ufffd of a recognized cause of action (556 U.S. at 681) makes a complaint adequate to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. This makes sense; otherwise lawyers might simply copy the elements from a form book, without tying those elements to the facts of their case, and survive a motion to dismiss. The  Iqbal  Court clearly wants some factual meat on the bones of legal theory, to show that the plaintiff not only pursues an existing cause of action, but also has at least a preliminary evidentiary basis for the allegations it must establish to recover. Although the plaintiff needs to plead facts, the court will still\ufffdeven after  Iqbal \ufffdassume the truth of the facts alleged in passing on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. So  A  is true. Clearly, this must be the plaintiff\ufffds strategy for survival in a post- Iqbal  pleading world: to supply (within the limits of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3)) what  Iqbal  demands, some supporting facts that suggest a violation of her rights. In  16630 Southfield , the court noted that the most plausible inference from the plaintiff\ufffds complaint is that the bank refused an extension to a debtor whose past record indicated it was unlikely to be able to pay. The  Southfield  plaintiff, in order to proceed, would have to provide the court with  something  in the way of evidence to show that the alternative inference\ufffdethnic discrimination\ufffdis plausible. Because the  Southfield  complaint failed to do that, the Sixth Circuit, applying the  Twombly/Iqbal  pleading standard, affirmed the dismissal of the complaint.

This is a crucial distinction. It is still true, after  Bell  and  Iqbal , that the court in passing on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion will assume the truth of the  facts  alleged.

This is a factual allegation. {QC 2}\n\nStep 4: Option C (\"The defendants discriminated...\") is a conclusory statement. It's a legal conclusion mirroring the \"formulaic recitation\" criticized in Iqbal. It doesn't detail the factual basis for the discrimination. {QC 2, QC 3}\n\nStep 5: Option D (\"The defendant is indebted...\") is a legal conclusion. It asserts a legal relationship (debt) without detailing the underlying facts supporting the debt. {QC 2}\n\nStep 6:  Options A and B present factual allegations, while options C and D present legal conclusions.

Both A and B meet this criteria.  However, the question implies a single best answer.  Since both A and B are equally valid choices based on the provided context, neither is definitively superior.  Additional context would be needed to choose between them.  Given the constraints, both A and B are acceptable answers.\n\n"

In the second claim for relief, he asserts that Nuclear was aware at the time of his employment that its facility exposed employees to elevated radiation levels that could cause leukemia, but failed to warn him of that risk or take steps to reduce it. In the third claim for relief, he alleges that after he had left Nuclear\ufffds employ, it learned of the risk of leukemia from the radiation levels its employees encountered at the facility, but failed to warn him so that he could obtain proper medical treatment and monitoring.",

            "Analysis": "C  is clearly wrong here; so wrong that I just threw it in to distract. The fact that any one of these may be true hardly shows that Singh\ufffds three counts are not inconsistent. Singh\ufffds allegations in Counts One, Two, and Three can\ufffdt all be true. Count One alleges that they never knew of the risk from exposure at the facility, but should have. Count Two alleges that they knew about the risk when he worked there, but failed to take precautions against it. And Count Three alleges that they learned of the risk later. Certainly, all three versions can\ufffdt be true, and probably only one of them can. But Singh may not be aware of which it is when he files his complaint. He may have some evidence to support each version, and hope to develop a clearer understanding of \ufffd\ufffdwhat did they know and when did they know it\ufffd\ufffd through discovery. After all, Nuclear isn\ufffdt likely to  tell  him which version is true without being compelled to reveal information through discovery. Perhaps the most tantalizing distractor is  D , which suggests that Singh can\ufffdt plead all three versions of his claim if he has significantly more evidence for one of them than the others. If this choice were right, it would mean that Singh would have to choose the version of his claim that he thinks is most likely true at the time of pleading, even if his investigation suggests that one of the others might be. Rule 8(d)(3) is meant to relieve the pleader from having to make that choice among possible versions of his claim, by allowing him to plead whatever versions have evidentiary support. Singh\ufffds counsel is not required to pre- judge the strength of these three theories and abandon two because the preliminary evidence is stronger for the third. By pleading all three, he puts these allegations in play. The parties will proceed to discovery. Perhaps one or more will prove untenable, and be voluntarily withdrawn, or dismissed on summary judgment. Or, perhaps, at the time of trial, it will remain unclear what the true facts are, in which case all three theories will be tried, and the jury will decide what Nuclear knew, and when. B , then, is also wrong. Pleading three theories is permissible, even if only one of them can ultimately be true. Singh doesn\ufffdt plead these alternative versions of his claim because he expects to prove them all, but because he doesn\ufffdt know which one the jury will ultimately accept. Even though, logically, only one can be true, Singh can pursue them all through discovery and, if he still has evidentiary support for more than one, at trial as well.

            "Context": "The Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can\ufffdt all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\ufffds claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\ufffdt required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \ufffd\ufffdoverplead\ufffd\ufffd affirmative defenses.

Here\ufffds a question that explores the defendant\ufffds options.",

Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which is necessary in order to recover from the employer).

D.  AE should deny the allegation.",
            "Analysis": "This is a nice question. Clearly, AE doesn\ufffdt want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment, but it does have some evidence tending to support that position. What should it do? C  is \ufffd\ufffdwrongest.\ufffd\ufffd Rule 8(b)(5) provides that, where a party pleads that it doesn\ufffdt have enough information to admit or deny, that response \ufffd\ufffdhas the effect of a denial.\ufffd\ufffd (If this \ufffd\ufffdI dunno\ufffd\ufffd response were treated as an admission, parties would rarely use it.) Basically, this response keeps the defendant\ufffds options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case. Because the Rules treat this response as a denial,  C  is wrong. AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. B  also falls short. Rule 8 requires the pleader to admit or deny the allegations, or state that she is without sufficient information. Further, Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied in the answer are admitted. So ignoring the allegation would be ill advised. A  is an interesting suggestion. The rules expressly allow the parties to take different positions\ufffdwhere they don\ufffdt know the true facts\ufffd \ufffd\ufffdregardless of consistency.\ufffd\ufffd So, if you have some evidence suggesting that the allegation is true, and some suggesting that it is false, why not admit and deny? It\ufffds hard to plead more honestly than that! Of course, the defendant presumably does not  want  to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment. So the fact that it would be permissible to take inconsistent positions isn\ufffdt the end of the matter . . .  must  the defendant do so? Certainly not. A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules. Because AE has evidentiary support for the position that Adair did not act in the scope of his employment, a denial is proper. AE has grounds to admit it too, since they have some evidence of that as well, but clearly doesn\ufffdt want to raise that as a \ufffd\ufffddefense\ufffd\ufffd and isn\ufffdt required to.  D  is the best answer. If you work in a defense firm, I wouldn\ufffdt suggest that you recommend admitting a damaging allegation, simply because you have some information suggesting that it is true. Ordinarily, an admission removes the issue from contention (though perhaps not if admitted  and  denied!), and this one is still very much an open question. Where the defendant has grounds to deny a damaging allegation such as this, it may do so under the rules, and certainly will. An alternative would be to respond that AE is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the averment in Paragraph 4. This is permissible if you really don\ufffdt know, and leaves the issue open, since this response \ufffd\ufffdhas the effect of a denial.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). However, given its obligation under Rule 11 to conduct a reasonable investigation before answering, it seems likely that AE would know enough about Adair\ufffds meanderings to take a position on the scope of employment issue. Even if it could reply that it was \ufffd\ufffdwithout sufficient knowledge,\ufffd\ufffd  C  would still be wrong, since it states that this response is treated as an admission.",

            "Context": "Pleading multiple defenses and objections At common law, the defendant could take a number of positions regarding the case. She could \ufffd\ufffdtraverse the allegations,\ufffd\ufffd that is, deny the truth of the facts. If she did that, the case would go to trial to resolve the disputed facts. Or the defendant could \ufffd\ufffddemur to the complaint,\ufffd\ufffd that is, assert that the facts alleged, if proved, would not entitle the plaintiff to relief. This challenged the sufficiency of the averments in the complaint to support recovery under the law, not the factual truth of those averments. Or, the defendant could assert that, despite the validity of the plaintiff\ufffds prima facie claim, she loses anyway, due to some additional fact, such as the passage of the statute of limitations, or a release of the claim by settlement. Last, the defendant could raise various objections to the court\ufffds going forward, such as improper venue or lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Strict common law pleading did not allow the defendant to raise all of these defenses. If the defendant \ufffd\ufffdtraversed,\ufffd\ufffd she couldn\ufffdt demur as well. If she raised new matter to avoid liability (called a \ufffd\ufffdconfession and avoidance\ufffd\ufffd), she had to admit the truth of the plaintiff\ufffds allegations and rely solely on the defense to it\ufffdshe had to \ufffd\ufffdconfess\ufffd\ufffd in order to \ufffd\ufffdavoid.\ufffd\ufffd For example, if she wanted to raise the statute of limitations as a defense to a contract claim, she couldn\ufffdt  also  deny that she ever made the contract: to raise the limitations defense (\ufffd\ufffdthe avoidance\ufffd\ufffd) she had to confess the validity of the plaintiff\ufffds basic claim. Through this ruthless insistence that the defendant put all her eggs in one basket, the common law pleading system boiled cases down to single issues. A demurrer reduced it to the single question of law, \ufffd\ufffddoes the plaintiff\ufffds complaint state a claim upon which relief can be granted?\ufffd\ufffd Traversing the allegations reduced it to a dispute over the truth of the factual allegations. And a confession and avoidance reduced it to the validity of the affirmative defense (since the defendant, by raising one, admitted the truth of the plaintiff\ufffds case-in-chief). Maitland declared that \ufffd\ufffdthe forms of action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.\ufffd\ufffd 4  The old pleading rules are largely gone, but much of their substance remains. As under the common law, federal pleading recognizes traverses\ufffdthey are denials under Rule 8(b). It recognizes demurrers\ufffdnow challenges to the legal validity of the plaintiff\ufffds claim under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c). Similarly, federal pleading allows parties to avoid liability by raising affirmative defenses under Rule 8(c). Last, a defendant may also interpose procedural objections to the case, such as improper venue or lack of personal or subject matter jurisdiction. See Rule 12(b)(1), (2), (3). Plus \ufffda change, plus c\ufffdest la m\ufffdme. . . . 5  But there is an important difference from the common law. Under the Federal Rules, the defendant (much like the plaintiff in her complaint) may raise multiple objections to the plaintiff\ufffds case; she is not required to stake her case on one. She may deny that the parties made a contract, but also raise the affirmative defense that the limitations period bars enforcing it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1), which gives a (non-exhaustive) list of affirmative defenses that may be included in an answer. She may deny that she caused emotional distress to the plaintiff, but also claim that there\ufffds no cause of action for infliction of emotional distress and that the court lacks jurisdiction over her. And so on. Once again, the Rules flexibly allow the pleader to state whatever positions she has evidentiary support for, \ufffd\ufffdregardless of consistency.\ufffd\ufffd But the various positions are, basically, recognizable descendants of common law devices: the traverse, the demurrer, the confession and avoidance, or pleas to the court\ufffds jurisdiction. It\ufffds useful to be able to classify defenses appropriately under these four categories. This question offers a chance to do that.",
            "Question": "11. Closer and closer.  Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc. in federal court, for injuries suffered in an accident while he was a passenger in a truck with Adair, one of AE\ufffds delivery drivers. He bases jurisdiction on diversity. Patterson\ufffds complaint alleges that he is an employee of AE, that Adair is also an AE employee, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident, and that Adair was negligent in causing the accident. The jurisdiction applies joint and several liability. In its answer, AE asserts the following defenses (among others): 1.  \ufffd\ufffdAdair was not negligent, because he acted reasonably in a sudden emergency.\ufffd\ufffd 2.  \ufffd\ufffdThe court lacks power to hear the case, because Patterson is from the same state as AE.\ufffd\ufffd 3.  \ufffd\ufffdThe plaintiff cannot recover, because he is covered by the workers compensation statute, which bars suits by a covered employee against his employer. She may only recover statutory benefits from the workers\ufffd compensation insurer.\ufffd\ufffd 4.  \ufffd\ufffdThe plaintiff cannot recover from the defendant because the injury resulted solely from the negligence of Chang, the other driver involved in the accident.\ufffd\ufffd 5.  \ufffd\ufffdThe plaintiff cannot recover, because in riding in the open bed of the truck, he was more negligent than Adair.\ufffd\ufffd (Under the relevant comparative negligence statute, a plaintiff who is more negligent than the defendant is not entitled to recover.)",
            "Options": "Options: A.  AE\ufffds answer contains a denial, a jurisdictional objection, one defense of failure to state a claim, and two affirmative defenses. B.  AE\ufffds answer contains two denials, a jurisdictional objection, one defense of failure to state a claim, and one affirmative defense. C.  AE\ufffds answer contains two denials, two defenses of failure to state a claim, and one affirmative defense.",
            "Analysis": "This is a hard question. I probably wouldn\ufffdt give it on an exam, because first-year students are just getting a feel for pleading, so classifying these isn\ufffdt easy. But it illustrates how subtly the different positions the defendant may take resemble each other. And, it may be important to analyze which is which for various reasons, such as the burden of proof at trial, or whether the defense can be resolved by a motion rather than at trial. The first defense is clearly a denial. The plaintiff alleges that Adair was negligent, and the defendant says that he wasn\ufffdt, that he acted reasonably in responding to an emergency situation. That raises a dispute of fact to be litigated and tried. The second defense is also straightforward: It challenges the court\ufffds subject matter jurisdiction. It isn\ufffdt as explicitly pleaded as it might be. A tidier statement of the objection would be, \ufffd\ufffdThe court lacks subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \ufffd1332(a), because the parties are both citizens of Minnesota.\ufffd\ufffd But it clearly goes to the authority of the federal court to hear the case. The third defense is tougher. It takes the position that Patterson can\ufffdt recover because the legislature has barred employees from suing their employers for injuries on the job. This defense asserts that Patterson\ufffds complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, that there\ufffds no right to recover in negligence from the employer for injuries suffered on the job. Therefore, Patterson\ufffds negligence complaint\ufffdwhich itself alleges that Patterson was an employee of AE\ufffd seeks recovery that the court can\ufffdt grant. Suppose that AE, instead of filing an answer, had filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. If the workers comp statute bars negligence recovery in the circumstances Patterson has alleged, that motion would be granted, because the complaint makes clear that Patterson seeks recovery for an injury on the job due to the negligence of another employee, and that right doesn\ufffdt exist. The fourth defense takes the position that the negligence claim will fail, because the accident resulted from the other driver\ufffds negligence. Analytically, this is just another way of denying that Adair was negligent. Patterson has alleged that Adair was negligent, and that Patterson can recover for that negligence. This defense says, \ufffd\ufffdNo, he wasn\ufffdt; you may have alleged a negligence cause of action but you can\ufffdt prove that.\ufffd\ufffd While the third defense asserts that negligence law doesn\ufffdt apply, because of the workers compensation statute, the fourth defense says, \ufffd\ufffdeven if negligence law applies, and we would be liable for Adair\ufffds negligence, we aren\ufffdt liable because he wasn\ufffdt negligent; the other driver was.\ufffd\ufffd This defense could not be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion: It requires a decision of the factual question whether Adair\ufffds negligence contributed to Patterson\ufffds injury. If the jury finds that only the other driver was negligent, AE would win, not because another driver\ufffds negligence is an affirmative defense to Patterson\ufffds claim, 6  but because Adair was  not  negligent, so Patterson cannot prove the prima facie negligence case he has alleged. How about the fifth defense? AE alleges that negligence law applies, but that under relevant negligence law a plaintiff can\ufffdt recover if he was more negligent than the defendant, and that is what happened here. This is an affirmative defense. Patterson claims he is entitled to recover from AE because Adair, its employee, negligently caused the injury. If he proves that (and if negligence law applies) he could recover. But AE raises new facts, not pleaded by the plaintiff, that alter the situation. \ufffd\ufffdPatterson, you may have stated a negligence claim by alleging that Adair was negligent and that his negligence led to the accident, but we say that you were more negligent, which bars recovery even if Adair was negligent.\ufffd\ufffd This defense doesn\ufffdt say that there\ufffds no right to recover for negligence. Rather, it says that, even if Patterson proves his prima facie case, his right to recover is undermined by additional facts. Just to highlight the difference between #5 and #3, imagine that AE moved to dismiss Patterson\ufffds complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, on the ground that Patterson was more negligent than Adair. The motion would be denied. Patterson\ufffds complaint states a good cause of action (if workers comp doesn\ufffdt apply): he  could recover if he proves that Adair\ufffds negligence was the primary cause of his injuries. AE\ufffds comparative negligence defense does not show that Patterson hasn\ufffdt asserted a legally recognized claim. Rather, it asserts that AE has a defense to it. The judge would deny the motion, stating \ufffd\ufffdthat\ufffds a matter of proof. If we try the case and you establish that Patterson was more negligent, then Patterson loses, not because his complaint fails to state a legally recognized claim, but because you have proved additional facts that avoid recovery anyway.\ufffd\ufffd That\ufffds an affirmative defense. So, let\ufffds see. #1: Denial. #2: Jurisdictional objection. #3: Failure to state a claim. #4: Denial. #5: Affirmative defense. The tally is two denials, one jurisdictional objection, one Rule 12(b)(6) defense, and one affirmative defense.  B  wins.",

So Malone\ufffds right to amend without leave is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). That devilish subsection provides that Malone may amend as of right within twenty-one days after Farrell serves her responsive pleading on Malone. She answered the counterclaim on January 29, so the amendment on February 16 is timely. So B is wrong; Malone can still amend as of right. A is the right choice here. If you grasp the reasoning for this provision allowing the party to amend after receiving the responsive pleading, you are more likely to remember it. When Malone got Farrell\ufffds answer to the counterclaim, she realized that Farrell\ufffds no-contract defense was right, so she could not recover on a contract theory.

            "Context": "Amendments with leave of court. Usually, the occasion to seek an amendment arises later in the action, as parties review documents, depose witnesses, prepare testimony, and research their legal claims and defenses. Thus, the time for amendment as of right will have passed, and the party who wants to amend will have to seek leave of court\ufffdthat is, the judge\ufffds permission\ufffdor consent of the other party, to amend the pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Under Rule 15(a)(2), the judge should generally grant amendments, so that cases can proceed based on the parties\ufffd educated understanding of the facts and theories of recovery. If a party has learned that the facts are not what she initially pleaded, or that she should have alleged a different legal claim or defense than she did at the outset, she should be allowed to amend the pleadings to conform to her evolving understanding of her case. The goal is to have the trial reflect the true state of the evidence, not the parties\ufffd initial understandings when they filed the complaint and answer. If parties were stuck with the positions in the complaint and answer, they would frequently have to try the case based on allegations or defenses that appeared correct at the time, but were not borne out by further research and discovery. The whole thrust of the Federal Rules is to avoid such calcification of legal procedure. Consequently, Rule 15(a) (2) provides that the court should \ufffd\ufffdfreely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\ufffd\ufffd The presumption, especially early in the litigation, is that amendments will be allowed, so that the issues framed for trial will reflect the parties\ufffd fully developed understanding of the case. However, while amendments are liberally allowed, they are not always granted. A common reason to deny leave to amend is that the amendment is offered too late, when the opposing party will be unable to develop the evidence or arguments to meet the new allegation. As trial approaches, the tension increases between the premium the Federal Rules place on flexibility to reframe the issues and the due process right to an adequate opportunity to meet the claim.

            "Question": "3. The latest news.  Quarles sues the City of Decatur for injuries caused by its employee, Fred, driving a City of Decatur Parks Department pickup truck. In her complaint, she alleges that Fred was acting in the scope of his employment as a parks employee for the City at the time of the accident. The City\ufffds counsel checks the time sheets for the day of the accident, which indicate that Fred was working that day, and the accident report, which indicates that the truck involved was a City vehicle. The City then answered the complaint, admitting that Fred acted in the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Five months later, one month prior to the date for finishing discovery, the City\ufffds lawyer meets with Barbara, Fred\ufffds immediate supervisor, to prepare for her deposition. Barbara explains that, while Fred did come to work that day, she had let Fred go an hour before the accident to visit his sick mother, and let him take the truck to drive to the hospital. Barbara had known this all along, but had not volunteered this awkward bit of information until directly interviewed by the City\ufffds counsel. Upon learning this, the City\ufffds lawyer moves to amend its answer to deny that Fred acted in the scope of employment. The amendment will probably",
            "Options": "Options: A.  be denied, because Barbara was aware when the complaint was filed that Fred was not on the job at the time of the accident. B.  be denied, because it attempts to change the defendant\ufffds position as to the facts, not add or change a legal claim or defense. C.  be allowed, because discovery is not yet complete and Quarles will still be able to prepare to meet the amended allegation at trial. D.  be denied, because it comes shortly before the close of discovery.",
            "Analysis": "Note that in this question it is the defendant who took one position in its answer and later wants to change its position. Rule 15\ufffds standards for amendment apply equally to parties asserting claims and parties defending against them. The City\ufffds amendment attempts to change its position on a crucial issue in the case: If Fred did not act in the scope of employment, the city isn\ufffdt liable for his negligence. Needless to say, the plaintiff will oppose the amendment vigorously. Certainly, the rules favor trying that issue on the merits, rather than foreclosing the issue because the city admitted that Fred acted in the scope of employment when it first filed its answer. But time has gone by, the parties are supposed to be almost through with discovery, and this raises a new issue that formerly appeared to be settled by the City\ufffds answer, and that Quarles would now have to prepare to meet at trial. So there are values to be balanced on both sides, which is what exercises of discretion are all about. Let\ufffds look at the options.  B  suggests that the amendment should not be allowed, because it attempts to change the City\ufffds position about the facts, not its legal contentions. However, Rule 15 makes no distinction between factual and legal changes to the pleadings. Very frequently, the parties\ufffd understanding about the facts will evolve, especially as they take discovery from nonparty witnesses and from opposing parties. The philosophy behind the rule is to allow the parties, where consistent with fairness, to change the pleadings to reflect their evolving understanding of both the facts and their legal positions based on the facts. Here, for example, if the amendment were allowed, and it looked as though the City would probably prove that Fred didn\ufffdt act in the scope of employment, Quarles might wish to change her allegations too. For example, she might seek to amend to add a claim for negligent entrustment of the truck to Fred. A  takes the position that the amendment should be denied because a city employee\ufffdthough not counsel for the city\ufffdknew all along that Fred had not been working at the time of the accident. This suggests that, if the true facts could have been discovered by the City\ufffds lawyer, but weren\ufffdt, the amendment should be denied. If this were so, counsel would have to do exhaustive investigation before pleading, and would be bound by what they knew when they filed the complaint or answer, without a right to amend if they learned later that what they pleaded was wrong. This is a heavy burden, heavier than the rule-makers chose to impose on litigants. Instead, under Rule 15(a) leave to amend should be freely given \ufffd\ufffdwhen justice so requires.\ufffd\ufffd Even if counsel might have discovered her error by more exhaustive pre-pleading investigation, the rules don\ufffdt give first priority to punishing lawyers\ufffd lapses. Rather, first priority goes to trying cases on the merits. Here, trying the dispute on the merits would clearly be facilitated by allowing the amendment, even if the need for an amendment might have been averted by more intensive pre-pleading investigation. So the view reflected by  A , that \ufffd\ufffdyou could have known this, so you should stew in your own juice,\ufffd\ufffd is unlikely to decide the amendment motion. The answer might be different if the amendment had been sought immediately before trial, or if it was clear that the City\ufffds lawyer had done no investigation of the facts before filing its answer. C  and  D  are closer options. The amendment is sought fairly far down the line towards trial. But discovery is not complete yet; there\ufffds some time to do more. And, the judge could extend the time for discovery if the amendment is allowed, to give Quarles an opportunity to meet the City\ufffds denial of the acting-in-the-scope allegation. On the other side of the ledger, whether Fred acted in the scope of employment is fundamental to the plaintiff\ufffds right to recover. To deny this amendment is to bar the City from raising a complete, possibly valid defense to liability. Judges don\ufffdt like to do that. And here, the City\ufffds counsel had investigated before answering and had reasonable grounds to admit the allegation. Absent evidence of bad faith, or deliberate delay in offering the amendment, the judge in this situation would likely allow the amendment, so that this issue can be tried on the merits, rather than foreclosed by an early misimpression.  C  is the best choice.",

            "Context": "Amendments with leave of court. Usually, the occasion to seek an amendment arises later in the action, as parties review documents, depose witnesses, prepare testimony, and research their legal claims and defenses. Thus, the time for amendment as of right will have passed, and the party who wants to amend will have to seek leave of court\ufffdthat is, the judge\ufffds permission\ufffdor consent of the other party, to amend the pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Under Rule 15(a)(2), the judge should generally grant amendments, so that cases can proceed based on the parties\ufffd educated understanding of the facts and theories of recovery. If a party has learned that the facts are not what she initially pleaded, or that she should have alleged a different legal claim or defense than she did at the outset, she should be allowed to amend the pleadings to conform to her evolving understanding of her case. The goal is to have the trial reflect the true state of the evidence, not the parties\ufffd initial understandings when they filed the complaint and answer. If parties were stuck with the positions in the complaint and answer, they would frequently have to try the case based on allegations or defenses that appeared correct at the time, but were not borne out by further research and discovery. The whole thrust of the Federal Rules is to avoid such calcification of legal procedure. Consequently, Rule 15(a) (2) provides that the court should \ufffd\ufffdfreely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\ufffd\ufffd The presumption, especially early in the litigation, is that amendments will be allowed, so that the issues framed for trial will reflect the parties\ufffd fully developed understanding of the case. However, while amendments are liberally allowed, they are not always granted. A common reason to deny leave to amend is that the amendment is offered too late, when the opposing party will be unable to develop the evidence or arguments to meet the new allegation. As trial approaches, the tension increases between the premium the Federal Rules place on flexibility to reframe the issues and the due process right to an adequate opportunity to meet the claim. A change of position that might be fair in the first weeks of a case would be manifestly unfair a week before trial.

            "Question": "4. Hedging bets.  Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring a suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the vehicle. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable, without fault, for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. At a discovery conference, the federal judge sets a schedule for discovery that calls for completion of discovery in nine months, and trial several months thereafter. Six months later, Pope remembers what is basic black letter law in his state: that conscious misuse would be a complete defense to Jhala\ufffds products liability claim, but misuse would only reduce recovery (under comparative negligence) if he sued on a negligence theory. He moves to amend to assert a second claim for relief, alleging that Adventure was negligent in designing the vehicle with too narrow a wheel base. The judge will likely",
            "Options": "Options: A.  deny the amendment, because it would add an additional theory of recovery, rather than changing the theory asserted in the initial complaint. B.  deny the amendment, if she concludes that Pope should have thought of this theory when he filed the initial complaint. C.  deny the amendment, because Jhala can still proceed on a strict products liability theory, and may recover on this ground. D.  allow the amendment, because it facilitates a decision on the merits, even if Jhala\ufffds counsel should have asserted it in the initial complaint.",
            "Analysis": "This example is quite similar to the previous one. Here, as there, the amended pleading could have been the original pleading if counsel\ufffds preparation had been a bit more aggressive. Had Pope reviewed basic theories of tort recovery, this difference in defenses to negligence and strict liability would have been clear to him. Indeed, if he regularly does personal injury work, he probably should simply have known it. But he didn\ufffdt, or he forgot, or was in a rush when he drafted the complaint, so now he wants to fix things by adding the negligence claim. The argument for allowing the amendment is a little weaker here, though. In the first example, the City\ufffds counsel was under an understandable misimpression about the facts, which were later clarified by further discovery. In Jhala\ufffds case, Pope didn\ufffdt need any additional facts to realize the need to plead the additional claim, he only needed to think a bit harder about the legal issues, or do some further legal research to realize that he should include a negligence claim. A  suggests that Pope can\ufffdt amend because he would be adding a new theory of recovery. However, nothing in Rule 15(a) suggests that amendments that add new theories of recovery\ufffdor new defenses\ufffdare off-limits. They aren\ufffdt. Very frequently, parties will seek to add additional claims for relief or defenses, based on newly developed facts or further legal research and analysis. Once again, the priority of the rules is presentation on the merits, so these are commonly allowed, as long as the defendant isn\ufffdt prejudiced due to an unreasonable delay in seeking the amendment, or the fact that trial is imminent. B  argues that the amendment should be denied if Jhala\ufffds lawyer should have thought of it initially. But the test isn\ufffdt whether counsel made a mistake; it is whether justice would be furthered by allowing the party to litigate a position rather than foreclosing it. Justice to the client will frequently support amendments, even if they do stem from counsel\ufffds negligence. I wouldn\ufffdt want to state this as an ironclad rule. Certainly, one factor in rejecting an amendment is that there is no reason why it couldn\ufffdt have been included in the original pleading. Sometimes it will be clear that the omission reflects egregious sloppiness\ufffdor deliberate tactical delay\ufffdthat should not be tolerated, at least if the amendment comes close to trial. But more often, amendments are likely to be granted to correct oversights, even if they might have been avoided by more careful pre- filing analysis. C  suggests that the amendment should be denied because Jhala might still win on the products liability theory, even if barred from asserting the additional negligence claim. But Rule 15(a)(2) favors allowing the parties to present all their claims and defenses, even if belatedly invoked. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3) (pleading may assert as many claims or defenses as the party has). It would be cold comfort to Jhala to be told that he can\ufffdt present his strongest claim because he can still proceed with a weaker one. It is unlikely that the court would do so. Given the fact that the amendment comes while there is still three months for further discovery, the judge would very likely allow the amendment, as  D indicates. There\ufffds another reason why \ufffd\ufffdjustice\ufffd\ufffd would support allowing the amendment here. Doubtless, the parties were  already investigating Jhala\ufffds conduct , since misuse of the vehicle would be a complete defense to the original products liability claim. Adding a negligence claim means that his conduct will be assessed against an additional standard, but the parties were very likely already developing the factual evidence about that conduct before the amendment. Consequently, allowing the amendment will not likely prejudice Adventure\ufffds ability to present a full defense. Despite the last two questions, I don\ufffdt want to leave the impression that amendments are always granted. They aren\ufffdt. As the case gets close to trial, the prejudice to the opposing party, who must gear up to meet an unexpected claim or defense, is likely to counterbalance the policy in favor of amendments, especially if a court-established deadline for amendments has passed. Other factors that may overcome the presumption in favor of amendment include the absence of any reason for delay in asserting a claim or defense, and the fact that the amended claim or defense would be legally insufficient anyway.",

            "Context": "Relation back of amendments. Special problems arise when the plaintiff seeks to amend to add additional claims, or change the nature of her claims, after the statute of limitations has expired. The rule-makers addressed this problem in Rule 15(c). Let\ufffds start with Rule 15(c)(1), which deals with the most common situation, in which the plaintiff files the complaint within the limitations period, the limitations period passes, and later the plaintiff wants to amend her complaint to add another claim. Rule 15(c)(1) provides: When an Amendment Relates Back.  An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\ufffdor attempted to be set out\ufffdin the original pleading . . . What does it mean that the amendment \ufffd\ufffdrelates back\ufffd\ufffd if it arises from the same underlying events alleged in the original pleading? It means that the amended complaint, containing the new claim, will be treated as though it had been filed when the original complaint was filed. What\ufffds the point of this? It is intended to make clear that the statute of limitations is not a defense to new claims in the amended complaint, any more than it was to the original claim.  Assume that Roberts sues Morales for breach of contract, based on the sale of a quantity of men\ufffds suits Morales sold to him on March 15, 2013. He files suit on March 1, 2016, just before the three-year limitations period for contract claims in the relevant jurisdiction runs out. Four months later, he moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted the tort of fraud, a claim that also has a three-year limitations period. If Roberts had brought  no suit  until July of 2011, and then sued Morales for fraud, the fraud claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. But here, Roberts  did  sue Morales for this sale of goods before the passage of the limitations period. All he wants to do now is to add to his complaint another theory of recovery for the sale. Under Rule 15(c)(1) (B), if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016, before the statute of limitations passed. Why does the rule allow this bit of legal fiction? The purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure that the defendant has notice of a claim within a given period of time, so she can adequately prepare to defend that claim. Here, Roberts put Morales on notice that he would have to defend his conduct involving the March 15, 2013 sale when he sued him on March 1, 2011, within the limitations period. Morales should realize, as of that date, that he will have to defend that sale, and gather the evidence to do so before it disappears. True, he thinks he has to defend a contract claim  based on the sale, not a fraud claim. But Rule 15(c)(1)(B) reflects the rule-makers\ufffd conclusion that, once a defendant has been put on notice that particular conduct will be litigated\ufffdthe March 15, 2013 sale\ufffdthe purpose of the limitations period is satisfied. Consequently, since Roberts sued Morales for the sale before the limitations period ran, Roberts should be allowed to assert whatever claims or theories he has arising from that sale, even if he thinks of additional theories later. Otherwise, Roberts would have to develop his whole case before March 15, 2013, not just sue Morales by that date. Here\ufffds an example to illustrate the point.",

On March 1, 2016, Roberts sues Morales for breach of contract, claiming that the men\ufffds suits were not Armani suits, as represented, but Brand X. The relevant limitations period for contract claims is three years. Six months later, on September 7, 2016, he amends his complaint to add a claim for breach of contract for the June 2013 delivery of women\ufffds dresses. He claims that they were irregulars rather than first quality.",

The amendment will not relate back under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), but the claim will not be barred by the statute of limitations if the judge grants leave to amend to add this claim.",
            "Analysis": "The key to this question is that the dress claim does not arise out of the same transaction as the suit claim. These are two separate sales at different times. Rule 15(c)(1)(B) can\ufffdt help Roberts here, because it says, \ufffd\ufffdIf you sued Morales for one set of events, you can amend the complaint to assert different theories or facts based on that set of events without encountering limitations problems.\ufffd\ufffd It doesn\ufffdt say, \ufffd\ufffdIf you sued Morales for one set of events, you can sue him later for a separate transaction at a different time, even though the statute of limitations has passed on that separate claim.\ufffd\ufffd Here, Roberts\ufffds original suit put Morales on notice that he must defend the sale of men\ufffds suits, but did not put him on notice of a claim arising from the sale of dresses. Roberts must put him on notice of a claim arising from  that sale  within the limitations period. He can\ufffdt argue, \ufffd\ufffdWell, I sued you for the suit claim within the limitations period, so I\ufffdm just amending to add another claim and it relates back.\ufffd\ufffd That\ufffds not what Rule 15(c)(1)(B) says, and it would undermine a state\ufffds limitations statute if it did. (Indeed, interpreting the rule to allow this would likely fail under  Erie/ Rules Enabling Act analysis, since it would abridge Morales\ufffds substantive right to be protected by the statute of limitations. See 28 U.S.C. \ufffd2072(b).) B  reflects the position that an amendment will relate back if it is based on the same legal theory as the original pleading. But Rule 15(c) (1)(B) requires that the amended claim arise from the  same events  as the original claim, not assert the same legal theory. So this choice is wrong, as is  C , which also asserts that this amendment would relate back. How about  D , which suggests that the dress claim can be added if the judge grants the motion to amend? It is true that Rule 15(a)(2) encourages judges to allow amendments; in fact, it tells them to bend over backwards to allow them \ufffd\ufffdwhere justice so requires.\ufffd\ufffd So can\ufffdt the judge just allow Roberts to amend his complaint to assert this claim, so that it can be heard on the merits? Well, the judge could allow Roberts to amend to assert this claim. But she certainly could not bar Morales from asserting a statute of limitations defense to it. Rule 15(c)(1)(B) says that a claim relates back if \ufffdand, by implication  only  if\ufffdit arises from the same events as the original claim. This one doesn\ufffdt, so the fact that Roberts filed suit on the suit claim does not affect any limitation defense to the dress claim. If the judge were to allow the amendment, Morales would plead the limitations period as a defense to the dress claim. The period ran on the dress claim on June 15, 2011. Whether filed as an independent suit or added to Roberts\ufffds initial action, the limitations period bars the claim. So  A  is the right answer here. Roberts cannot use Rule 15(c)(1)(B) to avoid the limitations defense on this separate claim.",

He files suit on March 1, 2016, just before the three-year limitations period for contract claims in the relevant jurisdiction runs out. Four months later, he moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted the tort of fraud, a claim that also has a three-year limitations period. If Roberts had brought  no suit  until July of 2011, and then sued Morales for fraud, the fraud claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. But here, Roberts  did  sue Morales for this sale of goods before the passage of the limitations period. All he wants to do now is to add to his complaint another theory of recovery for the sale. Under Rule 15(c)(1) (B), if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016, before the statute of limitations passed. Why does the rule allow this bit of legal fiction? The purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure that the defendant has notice of a claim within a given period of time, so she can adequately prepare to defend that claim. Here, Roberts put Morales on notice that he would have to defend his conduct involving the March 15, 2013 sale when he sued him on March 1, 2011, within the limitations period. Morales should realize, as of that date, that he will have to defend that sale, and gather the evidence to do so before it disappears. True, he thinks he has to defend a contract claim  based on the sale, not a fraud claim. But Rule 15(c)(1)(B) reflects the rule-makers\ufffd conclusion that, once a defendant has been put on notice that particular conduct will be litigated\ufffdthe March 15, 2013 sale\ufffdthe purpose of the limitations period is satisfied. Consequently, since Roberts sued Morales for the sale before the limitations period ran, Roberts should be allowed to assert whatever claims or theories he has arising from that sale, even if he thinks of additional theories later. Otherwise, Roberts would have to develop his whole case before March 15, 2013, not just sue Morales by that date. Here\ufffds an example to illustrate the point.",
            "Question": "6. Amendment rights?  In March 2014, shortly after a new mayor takes office, Harcourt is fired from her job as a City administrator. She sues the City for breach of contract in February 2016, one month before the two-year limitations period passes. The parties conduct discovery over the course of seventeen months. In July 2017, just before the pre-trial conference, Harcourt moves to amend to add a federal civil rights claim to her complaint, alleging that she was fired because she belonged to the outgoing mayor\ufffds party, and that the firing violates her First Amendment rights. A three-year limitations period applies to the civil rights claim. The judge holds a hearing on the motion to amend, and indicates reluctance to allow the motion, because it comes late in the litigation.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Even if the judge allows the amendment, it will not relate back under Rule15(c)(1)(B), because her new claim is based on a different legal theory. B.  If the judge denies the amendment, Harcourt will be barred by the statute of limitations from recovering on her civil rights claim. C.  If the judge denies the amendment, Harcourt can bring a separate action, which will relate back for limitations purposes to the date of filing of her breach of contract claim. D.  The judge must allow the amendment, because it arises out of the same events as the original contract claim.",
            "Analysis": "I like this question, because it highlights the effect of the judge\ufffds discretionary decision to grant or deny an amendment. The first issue is whether, if the judge grants the amendment, the civil rights allegation will \ufffd\ufffdrelate back\ufffd\ufffd to the original filing, that is, be treated as though it had been contained in the original complaint, which was filed before the three-year limitations period had passed.  A  is wrong, because, if the amendment were allowed, it  would  relate back, since it arises out of the same events\ufffdHarcourt\ufffds dismissal from her job\ufffdas the claim in the original complaint. Don\ufffdt be fooled by the fact that the new claim is based on a different legal theory from the first. Amendments very commonly add new theories. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(B), the amendment will relate back as long as it is based on the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence as the original claim. Consequently, if the judge grants the motion, the claim can proceed, and the limitations defense will not bar it. D  takes the position that the judge must grant the motion to amend, since the claim to be added by amendment arises out of the same events as the original claim. But nothing in Rule 15 says that an amendment must be allowed because it arises out of the same events as the original claim. Rule 15(c)(1)(B) says that,  if the amendment is allowed , and the amended claim arises from the same events as the original claim, it will \ufffd\ufffdrelate back.\ufffd\ufffd But the judge still has a discretionary decision to make, considering the various factors discussed earlier, whether to allow the amendment at all. She is not compelled to grant an improvident amendment just because it asserts a claim arising from the same underlying events as the original claim. The judge will first ask whether, given the circumstances, it is appropriate to allow the amendment, under the discretionary analysis of Rule 15(a)(2). If the answer is \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd then the \ufffd\ufffdsame-transaction-or-occurrence\ufffd\ufffd standard of Rule 15(c)(1)(B) determines whether it will relate back for limitations purposes. But suppose the judge denies the amendment? Then, of course, Harcourt\ufffds only recourse would be to file a separate suit on it.  C  takes the position that, if she does, the claim will relate back to the date of filing of the breach of contract complaint in her first suit. I suppose the argument for this would be that the City was put on notice (by the filing of her first suit) of her claim arising from the dismissal, so the limitations period should be deemed satisfied. Nice try, Harcourt, but this argument misreads Rule 15(c)(1)(B), which only allows amendments in the first suit to relate back, not separate actions Harcourt might bring against the defendant. The rule doesn\ufffdt say that Harcourt can bring a separate action against the City and adopt the date of filing of her previous suit to avoid a limitations defense! She can\ufffdt. If Harcourt\ufffds amendment is denied, and she then files a separate action on the civil rights claim, the limitations period will bar it, since her new action will have been filed after the three-year limitations period has expired. So  B  is right. If the judge allows Harcourt\ufffds amendment, she will be allowed to litigate the civil rights claim. If the judge denies the amendment, that claim is lost. Harcourt better have a darn good argument why she didn\ufffdt offer this amendment sooner. The question highlights the importance of the judge\ufffds discretionary decision whether to allow an amendment\ufffdand one reason why judges have a natural, human inclination to grant them.",

            "Context": "Amendments to add parties under Rule 15(c)(1)(C). There are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \ufffd\ufffdrelate back\ufffd\ufffd to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a  new defendant  to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \ufffd\ufffdrelate back\ufffd\ufffd to the date the original complaint was filed. \ufffd  First , the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \ufffd  Second , the defendant being added must have \ufffd\ufffdreceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\ufffd\ufffd Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \ufffd  Third , the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \ufffd\ufffdknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\ufffds identity.\ufffd\ufffd Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\ufffds case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\ufffdTel- Connect\ufffdwas actually the intended target of the suit. What\ufffds the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint 2 ) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).",
            "Question": "7. Black and White.  Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\ufffdt heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\ufffdt Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely",
            "Options": "Options: A.  not relate back, because it was filed after the limitations period had passed. B.  not relate back, because it was filed after the limitations period had passed and White was not on notice that he was the intended target of Williams\ufffds suit. C.  relate back, because White was aware, before the passage of the limitations period, that Black had been sued. D.  relate back, because it arises out of the same arrest alleged in the initial complaint.",
            "Analysis": "Here, Darrow has sued one defendant and discovers, after the time to sue the proper defendant has passed, that he sued the wrong officer. The limitations period for suing White has now passed. Darrow\ufffds only hope is to amend the timely-filed complaint against Black to make White the defendant. Darrow will doubtless reread Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) (1) in a cold sweat when he realizes the problem. This could croak his client\ufffds case. Even if he wasn\ufffdt negligent in suing Black, he won\ufffdt look forward to telling Williams if the case is thrown out. D  takes the position that the amended complaint will relate back, since it arises from the same arrest. This is wrong, because Rule 15(c)(1) (C) provides that the amendment will only relate back if that is true  and the two further requirements in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are met.  C  suggests that the amendment to add White will relate back, because White knew, within the limitations period for Williams\ufffds claim, that Black had been sued. But that isn\ufffdt enough under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) either. The rule requires that White receive, within the limitation period (plus the 90 days for service of the complaint), \ufffd\ufffdsuch notice of the action that [White] will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Knowledge that someone has sued Black for excessive force is hardly the equivalent of notice that Williams had mistakenly sued Black for the arrest made by White. The question indicates that other officers were not aware of the particular circumstances, so it is unlikely that White was on notice that Black had been sued for an arrest he (White) had made. Unless Williams could show that it would be clear to White that the suit must be for his arrest of Williams, so that, \ufffd\ufffdbut for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party\ufffd\ufffd he would have been the defendant, White doesn\ufffdt have the notice called for by Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). So  A  or  B  is the proper answer.  A  is very close. It is true that the amendment will not relate back because it was filed after the limitations period had passed. But it is not the best answer. It\ufffds a bit sloppy, because it suggests that an amendment to add a party can\ufffdt relate back if it is filed after the limitations period has passed. That isn\ufffdt so: If the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C) are met, it would be treated as though it had been filed at the time of the original complaint.  B  is the better answer. While the amendment could relate back, it doesn\ufffdt here, because White was not on notice that the action should have been filed against him. He knew that Black had been sued, but the question does not indicate that he understood that the suit was by Williams, or that it was for an arrest White had made. Thus, he is unaware, as Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) requires, that, \ufffd\ufffdbut for a mistake concerning the proper party\ufffds identity,\ufffd\ufffd the action would have been brought against him. This is a nice example of the difference between the \ufffd\ufffdbest\ufffd\ufffd answer and the \ufffd\ufffdright\ufffd\ufffd answer.  A  is arguably right\ufffdthe amendment will not relate back\ufffdbut  B  is tighter, more precise in reflecting the logic for that result.

            "Context": "Amendments under Rule 15(b) to conform to the evidence While the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn\ufffdt pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties\ufffd discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side\ufffds witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff\ufffds negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant\ufffds answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1)  Based on an Objection at Trial.  If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\ufffds action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings\ufffdat the trial itself\ufffdto expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff\ufffds comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not \ufffd\ufffdtried by the parties\ufffd express or implied consent.\ufffd\ufffd Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here\ufffds a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b).",
            "Question": "8. Ups and downs.  Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala\ufffds route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  allow the amendment, since evidence concerning Jhala\ufffds conduct in using the ORV was introduced at trial by both parties. B.  hold that the defendant waived this defense by failing to plead it in its answer. C.  treat the assumption-of-risk issue as though it had been pleaded, and instruct the jury on it. D.  deny the amendment, since the parties did not impliedly try the issue of assumption of the risk.",
            "Analysis": "The rationale for Rule 15(b) is that, if the parties knew they were trying an issue, and did, then the pleadings filed months or years earlier shouldn\ufffdt serve as a straitjacket that bars resolution of that issue. The premise for Rule 15(b) is, however, that the parties really did understand that the issue to be added by amendment was in the case and was being tried. Not just the party\ufffdlike Adventure here\ufffdwho wants to add the issue to the pleadings, but  both  parties must have understood that, to make such an amendment at trial fair. In this case, nothing suggests that Jhala expressly agreed that the assumption-of-risk issue was in contention. So the question is whether, when the parties introduced evidence about his conduct, they both understood that they were litigating assumption of the risk. There is no reason to believe that Jhala\ufffds counsel did understand that: The evidence about Jhala\ufffds route, his speed, and the slope of the hill were all relevant to a different issue that was already in the case: the defense that he was comparatively negligent in the way he used the ORV. Comparative negligence only requires that the plaintiff have acted unreasonably under the circumstances. By contrast, assumption of the risk requires that the plaintiff be fully aware of the defect in the ORV and choose to take his chances. The fact that Adventure introduced evidence about Jhala\ufffds conduct, which was relevant to an issue already in contention (negligence), would not put his counsel on notice that a different issue (assumption of the risk) with a different standard (actual knowledge and choice to encounter the risk) was being litigated. Thus,  A  and  C  are wrong. Jhala\ufffds natural inference would be that the evidence was introduced to prove Jhala\ufffds negligence, not his knowing assumption of the risk of a defective product. It would be unfair to spring this on him after the parties had rested their cases. The Rule 15(b) motion should be denied.  D  is the best response. There is an argument for  B . If Adventure is not allowed to amend, I suppose it has, in a sense, waived the defense. But it didn\ufffdt waive it just by leaving it out of the answer. Parties can frequently raise new issues that they left out of their initial pleadings\ufffdthat\ufffds what the liberal amendment rules are all about. Adventure could have raised it by an amendment as of right, or a later amendment with leave of court, or perhaps even by seeking an amendment at trial, though, as the question illustrates, if it is offered at trial, the court would have to grant a continuance to allow Jhala to meet the new defense.",

This constitutes implied consent to litigate the assumption of risk issue {QC 3, QC 4, QC 7}.\n\nStep 3: Rule 15(b)(1) permits amendments when evidence relevant to an unpleaded issue is introduced at trial, and the objecting party isn't prejudiced {QC 5}.  Since Jhala had the opportunity to present evidence addressing the issue of his conduct and the risk, he is not prejudiced by the late introduction of the assumption of risk defense.\n\nStep 4:  The goal of Rule 15(b) is to ensure that the pleadings reflect the issues actually litigated, promoting fairness and providing notice to the opposing party {QC 6}.  Allowing the amendment aligns with this goal, as the assumption of risk issue was implicitly tried by both parties {QC 3, QC 4}.\n\nStep 5:  Because the evidence presented by both parties implicitly addressed the issue of assumption of risk, and because allowing the amendment would not prejudice Jhala, the judge should allow the amendment under Rule 15(b)(1) {QC 5, QC 6}.  The judge should therefore treat the assumption of risk issue as though it had been pleaded and instruct the jury on it {QC 5, QC 6}.\n\nStep 6: Option A is partially correct in that evidence concerning Jhala's conduct was introduced, but it doesn't fully capture the legal reasoning under Rule 15(b). Option B is incorrect because the defense wasn't waived; it was implicitly tried. Option C accurately reflects the application of Rule 15(b) by treating the issue as pleaded and instructing the jury. Option D is incorrect because the parties did impliedly try the issue.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the correct option is C. The judge should treat the assumption-of-risk issue as though it had been pleaded and instruct the jury on it.\n\n\nFinal Answer: C\n"

            "Context": "The basic purpose and provisions of Rule 11 The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)",

A lawyer fails to answer a set of interrogatories propounded to her client by the opposing party. C.  A lawyer sends a letter to opposing counsel demanding damages for medical expenses which his client alleges she incurred, but actually did not. D.  A lawyer files a complaint seeking damages for medical expenses her client claims to have suffered, without seeking any evidence from the client that she incurred those expenses.",
            "Analysis": "Rule 11 does not apply to all acts in the course of litigation, or even to most. It applies only to representations made before the court. The first sentence of Rule 11(b) makes that clear: The certifications under the Rule apply when a lawyer or unrepresented party \ufffd\ufffdpresent[s] to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper\ufffdwhether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating\ufffd\ufffd that submission. In the question, only  D  involves such a filing. By filing the complaint, Middleton \ufffd\ufffdpresented to the court\ufffd\ufffd the demand for medical expenses. That act of filing the pleading triggers the representations in Rule 11(b) about positions taken in that pleading. If the claim for medical expenses is unsupported, and Middleton did not take adequate steps to determine whether there is support for it, she can be sanctioned for submitting it to the court.",

            "Question": "2. Try, try again.  In 2017, Hu witnesses an accident in West Dakota in which his son, John, is injured. He sues Olsen, the driver of the car that hit John, in federal court, seeking damages for the emotional distress he suffered from witnessing the accident. In 1998, the West Dakota Supreme Court had held in  Smith v. Chang  that there is no right to recover for emotional distress unless the plaintiff on the distress claim was also injured in the accident. (Hu was not.) The  Smith  court concluded that allowing recovery without a physical injury would open the door to too many fraudulent claims. In 2005, the supreme court of East Dakota, a neighboring state, held that a bystander may recover for emotional distress. It rejected the reasoning of  Smith , concluding that juries can adequately distinguish between genuine and fraudulent claims. Three other nearby states have rejected bystander emotional distress claims since 2000 or imposed limits on them which Hu could not meet. Two other states recently allowed recovery. Coincidentally, Hu\ufffds counsel had sued for emotional distress on behalf of another client in 2016, two years before Hu brought his case. In that case,  Bubbles v. Tripp , the trial court had dismissed the case, holding that the  Smith  case was binding authority in West Dakota, and that Hu\ufffds client could not recover, since she was not injured in the accident. Bubbles\ufffds counsel did not appeal that ruling.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Hu\ufffds counsel has violated Rule 11(b)(2) by asserting Hu\ufffds claim for emotional distress, since  Smith v.

D.  Hu\ufffds counsel has not violated Rule 11(b)(2), because he has support for an argument that  Smith should be overruled. The trial court\ufffds rejection of the argument in  Bubbles  does not make the argument frivolous.",
            "Analysis": "In this example, Hu\ufffds counsel, by filing a complaint seeking recovery for indirect infliction of emotional distress, asserts that there is a legal right to recover on such a claim. But  Smith , from the state supreme court, rejected that position.  Smith  is twenty years old, and the decisions from other states have been mixed, several recognizing the right and several rejecting it. When Hu\ufffds counsel made the argument two years before, the trial court dismissed his complaint on the merits. Let\ufffds start with  A , which asserts that Hu\ufffds counsel violates Rule 11(b)(2), because  Smith  is on point and rejected recovery for bystander emotional distress. Surely this can\ufffdt be the Law, can it? That you can\ufffdt argue for overruling a case on point? Rule 11(b)(2) doesn\ufffdt say that; indeed, it clearly suggests that you may argue for reversal of current law if you have a colorable argument for it. If Hu\ufffds counsel has a \ufffd\ufffdnonfrivolous argument\ufffd\ufffd for reversal of  Smith v. Chang , he has the right to make it, even if that argument did not convince the court back in the twentieth century. B  is more befuddling. The trial court in  Bubbles  considered the same legal position two years ago, and rejected it. So, Hu\ufffds counsel has made the argument recently and lost on it. Can he persist in the face of that recent ruling? Well, the trial judge probably dismissed  Bubbles  because she felt bound by the state supreme court\ufffds opinion in  Smith ! So, the Bubbles  ruling doesn\ufffdt mean that there\ufffds no credible argument for recovery for bystander emotional distress. It simply means that the trial judge did not feel free to accept that argument in the face of a binding precedent from West Dakota\ufffds highest court. If Hu\ufffds counsel wants to get the law changed, he\ufffds going to have to argue for it in the trial court, lose, take an appeal and convince the West Dakota Supreme Court to overrule Smith v. Chang . C  is sort of lukewarmly right, but hardly precise. Hu\ufffds counsel does not have an  unlimited  right to argue for change in the law. He has to have a credible ground to support the argument. And, while another trial court would not be bound to follow  Bubbles , it would probably feel bound to follow  Smith . So, it would rule the same way, rejecting the distress claim. So,  D  is the best answer. The fact that the trial court rejected his argument in  Bubbles  should not foreclose him from making the argument again, since the trial court did not reject his claim because there was no credible argument for it; it followed mandatory precedent from the West Dakota Supreme Court. And Hu\ufffds counsel has some support for overruling  Smith.  It\ufffds a twenty-year-old decision and several states have since recognized the claim, rejecting the reasoning in  Smith . While more states have rejected bystander distress claims than accepted them since Smith , nothing in Rule 11(b)(2) limits a litigant\ufffds arguments to those that have commanded majority support in other courts.",

            "Options": "Options: A.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a stranger was grievously injured. Although he knows that the West Carolina Supreme Court denied recovery for witnessing injury to a stranger ten months ago, Williams suffered very serious emotional trauma from the experience, and desperately needs funds for his psychiatric bills. B.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which her son was grievously injured. West Carolina has never addressed the right to recover for indirect infliction of emotional distress (that is, distress caused by witnessing injury to another person). C.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a close friend was grievously injured and died at the scene. The West Carolina Supreme Court recognized a right to recover for indirect infliction in 2002, but the opinion emphasized that the plaintiff was a close relative of the injured party. D.  Attorney Garcia files a complaint alleging that his client Williams has a right to recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress because he witnessed an accident in which a stranger was grievously injured. West Carolina recognized a right to recover for indirect infliction for witnessing serious injury to a family member in 2002, but in 2018 the West Carolina Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who witnessed injury to her fianc\ufffde could not recover for indirect infliction. The unanimous opinion expressed concern about creating \ufffd\ufffdunreasonably broad tort liability.\ufffd\ufffd E.  Both  A  and  D  might subject Garcia to sanctions.",
            "Analysis": "Garcia\ufffds conduct in  B  would not be sanctionable. West Carolina has never allowed recovery for indirect infliction, but it hasn\ufffdt rejected it either. Garcia is arguing for \ufffd\ufffdestablishing new law.\ufffd\ufffd There is nothing outlandish about arguing that this should constitute a compensable claim . . . many jurisdictions have allowed it. Maybe the West Carolina appellate courts have simply never been asked to recognize it. Garcia is entitled to do so. C  should also be appropriate under Rule 11(b)(2). The West Carolina Supreme Court has allowed recovery for indirect infliction. True, it noted that the plaintiff was a close relative of the direct victim, which suggests that the Court might not allow recovery if the direct victim was a stranger. However, the Court did not expressly preclude recovery in that case, and they did expand recovery for an indirect victim. Garcia is arguing for an \ufffd\ufffdextension of existing law.\ufffd\ufffd It would be nice if he could point to cases that have allowed such recovery, or other authority such as law review or treatise support for it. But even without that, it seems a fair argument to make. \ufffd\ufffdCourt, you have recognized that indirect victims suffer from a traumatic event like this; here\ufffds another sufferer deserving of compensation.\ufffd\ufffd The argument may not prevail, but it does not seem frivolous to give it a try. A  and  D , however, push the limits of acceptable advocacy. In  D , Garcia has probably stepped over that line. The West Carolina Supreme Court has recently considered which relationships will support an indirect infliction claim, and rejected such a claim where the plaintiff had a much stronger relation to the directly injured party than Williams had. Without some basis to renew the argument for a \ufffd\ufffdstranger indirect infliction claim,\ufffd\ufffd this seems unwarranted. In  A , Garcia\ufffds argument flies in the face of a quite recent case from the state\ufffds highest court rejecting liability on the exact facts of his case. Making the claim seems like a stubborn refusal to accept a settled issue rather than a credible argument for change in the law. It would be different if two adjoining states had reversed themselves on the issue since West Carolina\ufffds decision, but absent evidence like that to support an argument that the court might reverse course, this looks like obstinacy, not advocacy. So,  E  prevails. As a practical matter, some very able lawyers might push the Rule 11 bounds for a client in desperate need. They feel that they have to do all they can for such a client, not because they expect to win but because the client so clearly needs recovery. Perhaps they hope that, though they could not convince a court to recognize the claim, they will be able to settle it without a court ruling on the viability of the claim. The urge to help a desperate client is understandable, but advocacy on that basis still risks sanctions for stepping over the line. Committed counsel may well know that but sometimes give it a try anyway.",

The relevant restriction here is Rule l1(b)(3), and that rule bars filing a pleading or other paper alleging facts for which the filer has no evidentiary support. 2 That\ufffds what Garcia has done. That is sanctionable conduct under Rule 11(b)(3). So, the question, then, is who can be sanctioned for making these allegations. Clearly, Garcia can; he drafted the complaint and presented it to the court, so by doing so he certified that there was evidentiary support for the allegations. But didn\ufffdt he have evidentiary support for them, specifically his client\ufffds testimony? Perhaps if the statute of limitations was going to run in two hours that would justify filing this complaint. But barring that, Garcia has very likely run afoul of the requirement in Rule 11(b) that allegations only be submitted to the court \ufffd\ufffdafter an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.\ufffd\ufffd Garcia has made no inquiry here other than listening to a highly excitable, irate client. Surely he could have taken steps to corroborate aspects of Smithers\ufffds story before firing off a complaint and triggering significant court time and defense costs. He could have asked for pay records, correspondence with Acme, performance reviews, her letter of dismissal, perhaps taken the names of witnesses and talked to them. One of the purposes of Rule 11 is to incentivize lawyers to do their homework before invoking court process, rather than filing based on hope or instinct and delving into the facts later. So,  D  is wrong. We are down to  B  or  A , and the answer turns on whether Rule 11 authorizes sanctions against Smithers. She did not file anything with the court, so she has not certified that the facts are supportable. Can she be sanctioned? Yes, she can, but you have to dig a little to find the language that says so. Rule 11(c)(1) authorizes sanctions against \ufffd\ufffda party who violated the rule or  is responsible for the violation .\ufffd\ufffd (Italics added.)

Effectively, the pleader admits that she doesn\ufffdt have supporting evidence at the time of pleading, but sanguinely certifies that she expects to find some. Here again, the rule makers attempt to walk a thin line. They don\ufffdt want to allow groundless allegations made without evidentiary support. But they also don\ufffdt want to discourage parties from making allegations that may turn out to be true once the pleader has a full opportunity to develop her case. Often, information crucial to the plaintiff\ufffds case can only be obtained from the defendant through discovery. Yet discovery comes after pleading, not before.

            "Analysis": "This is one of those none-of-the-above questions in which none of the above is true.  A  is wrong, because Tolliver did not violate Rule 11 by making the allegation without supporting evidence. As the Rule allows, she revealed in her pleading that she lacked the supporting evidence for this allegation\ufffdbut expected to find it\ufffdby identifying it appropriately in the complaint. If, despite her conviction that she would find evidence of sex discrimination, she turns out to be wrong, she isn\ufffdt in violation of Rule 11. The Rule clearly contemplates that she may go forward to do investigation and discovery. It doesn\ufffdt say, \ufffd\ufffdwe\ufffdll let you take a shot at it but if you don\ufffdt turn anything up we will sanction you for unfounded allegations.\ufffd\ufffd Even if she fails to find the proof she suspected was out there, she hasn\ufffdt violated the Rule\ufffds certification requirement by making the allegation and searching for support for it. Nor does Rule 11 require Tolliver to affirmatively withdraw the allegation once she has completed discovery but found no supporting evidence. Under Rule 11(b) she is only barred from \ufffd\ufffdlater advocat[ing]\ufffd\ufffd an allegation once she has taken her full shot at developing the evidence and hasn\ufffdt found any. So,  B  fails, too. Since Tolliver need not withdraw the allegation, how will Acme know  if she is still advocating this position? One way it may find out is to send Tolliver a Rule 11(c)(2) motion, demanding that she withdraw the unsupported allegation. If Acme doesn\ufffdt do that, it may remain unclear at least until a pretrial conference whether the allegation is still in play. C  fails for the reason just stated. Once Tolliver has had the full opportunity to find supporting evidence for the allegation, and hasn\ufffdt found any, the Rule bars her from \ufffd\ufffdlater advocating\ufffd\ufffd that position. To take the sex discrimination claim to trial, after discovery is complete and she has found no support for it, would violate the certification requirement in Rule 11(b)(3). D  is wrong, too.

            "Context": "The \ufffd\ufffdsafe harbor\ufffd\ufffd provision in Rule 11(c)(2) Rule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \ufffd\ufffdsafe harbor\ufffd\ufffd provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent\ufffds filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that\ufffds the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court\ufffds time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry \ufffd\ufffdmea culpa!\ufffd\ufffd when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways.

            "Question": "6. The unsafe harbor.

The court enters an order dismissing the claim. Rendoso now moves for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2), on the ground that the legal position taken in Withers\ufffds complaint was frivolous. The court will likely",
            "Options": "Options: A.  deny the motion, because Rendoso failed to draft a motion for sanctions and send it to Withers as required by Rule 11(c)(2). B.  grant the motion. If a complaint is dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, it is by definition frivolous and sanctionable. C.  grant the motion, because Rendoso challenged the validity of the claim by moving to dismiss it under Rule 12(b)(6). D.  deny the motion, because the court can only impose sanctions if the paper was challenged under the Rule 11(c)(2) procedure.",
            "Analysis": "D  is contradicted by Rule 11(c)(3), which clearly allows a federal judge to initiate sanctions on his or her own, even though no party has moved for sanctions. Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. B  suggests an important point. The fact that a party\ufffds position on the merits is rejected by a court does not mean that a filing taking that position is automatically frivolous. Remember that the rule expressly allows litigants to argue for change or extension of existing law. Such arguments for change will be accepted in some cases but rejected in many. To subject all losing substantive arguments to sanctions would be inconsistent with the fundamental premise of Rule 11 and our common law system. C  should fail, and does. There\ufffds a difference between challenging the position taken in a pleading on its merits and challenging it as sanctionable conduct. Here, Rendoso did the former but not the latter. He did not ask for sanctions when the complaint was filed or before he moved to dismiss it. When he wins on the merits he decides to seek sanctions for what went before. The court is likely to hold, as most courts apparently do, that Rendoso\ufffds failure to use the \ufffd\ufffdsafe harbor\ufffd\ufffd provision to challenge the claim precludes him from seeking sanctions later on. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \ufffd1337.2. If Withers had sent a motion under Rule 11(c)(2), Rendoso might have seen the error of his ways and withdrawn the claim, saving time and expense for everyone. Withers cannot circumvent this procedure by waiting until the court expends time addressing the questionable claim and then filing a motion for sanctions directly with the court. Choose  A .",

However , if the defendant has certain objections to the case, she may raise them by a \ufffd\ufffdpre-answer motion\ufffd\ufffd before pleading, that is, before answering the complaint. If the defendant makes a pre-answer motion, it suspends the time for answering the complaint until the court addresses the objections raised in the motion. See Rule 12(a)(4)(A), (B). Rule 12(b) provides that the following objections may be made by a pre-answer motion: 1  . lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 2  . lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant; 3  . improper venue; 4  . insufficient process (that is, a defect in the summons required to be served on the defendant along with the complaint); 5  . insufficient service of process (that is, the method used to deliver the summons and complaint to the defendant); 6  . failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and 7  . failure to join a party under Rule 19 (that is, a person who must be made a party to the action to fairly adjudicate the case). One further pre-answer motion is squirreled away in Rule 12(e), the motion for a more definite statement. A Rule 12(e) motion asserts that the plaintiff\ufffds claim is so incomprehensible that the responding party cannot meaningfully respond to it, and asks the court to require the plaintiff to file a clearer complaint.

            "Context": "Rule 12(g): Limits on multiple pre-answer motions. The seven preliminary objections singled out in Rule 12(b) involve problems that might prevent the court from proceeding, or that need to be resolved at the outset of the case. Consequently, Rule 12 allows them to be raised immediately, and limits the defendant\ufffds ability to raise them later if they are  not  raised in a pre-answer motion or in the answer. First, let\ufffds consider what happens if the defendant  does  make a pre- answer motion, and leaves some objections out of it. Contrary to popular belief, Rule 12(g) does not provide that Rule 12(b) objections are waived if the defendant makes a pre-answer motion and leaves one out. All it says is that, if a party makes a pre-answer motion, and leaves out a preliminary objection that could have been included in the motion (was \ufffd\ufffdavailable\ufffd\ufffd to the moving party), the party can\ufffdt  make another pre- answer motion  based on the omitted objection. Rule 12(g)(2). For example, suppose that Cox moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(3) for improper venue, and the judge denies the motion. Rule 12(g)(2) provides that he cannot file a second pre-answer motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(5) for insufficiency of service of process. Because he made a pre-answer motion based on one of these objections, and left out the insufficiency-of-service objection, Cox \ufffd\ufffdmust not make another motion under this rule raising a defense or objection\ufffd\ufffd that was omitted from the first. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g). In other words, Cox, don\ufffdt harass the plaintiff with successive motions, each delaying the proceedings. If you have multiple Rule 12(b) objections, put them all in the first motion, so the judge can deal with them together. Note again that Rule 12(g)  doesn\ufffdt say that an omitted objection is waived . It only says that the defendant can\ufffdt make another pre-answer motion based on it. It is Rule 12(h) that does the dirty work. Rule 12(h) (1)(A) provides that four of these preliminary objections\ufffdpersonal jurisdiction, venue, sufficiency of process, and sufficiency of service of process\ufffdare waived if the defendant makes a pre-answer motion and leaves them out of the motion. I call these the \ufffd\ufffdfour disfavored defenses,\ufffd\ufffd because the Rule pronounces them waived if they are not asserted in a timely manner. Failure to join a party under Rule 19, failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction, however, are treated differently. Under Rule 12(g)(2), they may not be raised by a second pre-answer motion, if they were available and left out of the first. However, they may be asserted later in the litigation. Rule 12(h)(2). The following question illustrates the effect of Rule 12(g). It will help if you read Rule 12(g) carefully before you attempt it.",

The spirit of the rule is, \ufffd\ufffdif you have several of these objections when you file your pre-answer motion, file a combined motion based on all of them.\ufffd\ufffd But the available-to-the-party phrase creates an exception: If you couldn\ufffdt have asserted the objection in your first motion, you may file a second.

And it is here;  A  is right, because LaFleur could have raised the failure-to-state-a-claim objection in his first pre-answer motion, but didn\ufffdt. Rule 12(g)(2) says he can\ufffdt make a second pre-answer motion based on it. True, Rule 12(h)(2) says he can still raise it later. He can, which is why  B  is wrong. LaFleur does not lose the objection by leaving it out of the pre-answer motion. But he cannot make another pre-answer motion based on it. See Rule 12(g)(2). Thus,  C  is wrong. It\ufffds not quite true that the Rule 12(b)(6) objection may be raised at  any  time. While it may be raised later in the case, it may not be raised by another pre-answer motion. That said, it seems likely that many judges would blink at this limit in Rule 12(g) and hear the motion anyway. If there really is no claim upon which relief can be granted, it seems a waste to require an answer or proceed further.

A party who had run afoul of the rule would simply amend later\ufffdperhaps months or years later\ufffdto add the omitted defense to the answer. (Of course, this would not work if the party had made a pre-answer motion and left the defense out.) The rule-makers saw this one coming, and averted it by the language in Rule 12(h)(1)(B).

In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \ufffd\ufffdappears specially\ufffd\ufffd to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\ufffds easy enough to mix them up.

A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \ufffd\ufffdappear specially\ufffd\ufffd to contest the court\ufffds jurisdiction.

It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer.

The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court  has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal.

            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds deal first with a  major  source of confusion illustrated by  A . A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can\ufffdt wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: \ufffd\ufffdI think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I\ufffdd like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn\ufffdt agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I\ufffdd rather litigate this case in federal court.\ufffd\ufffd If this is the defendant\ufffds thinking, he has to remove, doesn\ufffdt he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: \ufffd\ufffdremove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.\ufffd\ufffd The rules don\ufffdt put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So  A  is wrong. C  is another loser. It suggests that the objection is still valid because under federal procedure it can be asserted in the answer. But  state procedure applies until removal, and under this state\ufffds procedure (the example indicates) you waive your objection by appearing in the action and failing to confine your objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction. And that\ufffds what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. So  B  is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\ufffdt be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court ( D ). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn\ufffdt respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here. I\ufffdve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection.

And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn\ufffdt raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court  has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal. Federal procedure applies once the case has been removed to federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1).",
            "Question": "9. Removing the objections.  Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Ten days later, before an answer is due in the state court, Hue removes the case to federal court. After removing, Hue answers the complaint, responding on the merits to the allegations in the complaint and also raising the objection that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him and that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction, because he did not include it in his first response to the complaint, the notice of removal. B.  Hue has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction, because he answered on the merits as well as raising the two Rule 12(b) objections in his answer. C.  Hue\ufffds objection to personal jurisdiction is properly raised in his answer. D.  Hue\ufffds objection to personal jurisdiction is waived, because the state court from which it was removed applies the special appearance rule.",
            "Analysis": "A  illustrates a common confusion about the relation between Rule 12 and removal. Rule 12 requires that the four \ufffd\ufffddisfavored defenses\ufffd\ufffd must be raised in the first response to the complaint, either the pre-answer motion or, if none is made, the answer. But suppose the defendant\ufffds first response to the complaint is to remove it to federal court? Does he waive the right to raise these defenses? No, no, no, no . . . NO! Removal does not affect the right to raise these objections; it only changes the forum in which they will be raised. While Rule 12 requires these objections to be asserted in the defendant\ufffds first response to the complaint, a notice of removal is not a response to the complaint, in the sense that an answer is, or a motion to dismiss. It\ufffds a response to the case itself, moving it to another court system. Nor does the language of Rule 12 state that removal waives these objections. Rule 12(h)(1) says these defenses are waived if they are left out of a pre- answer motion, or out of the answer (when no pre-answer motion is made). There\ufffds no mention of waiving them by removal. In the example, Hue hasn\ufffdt done anything that would waive his objection to personal jurisdiction. Under the Federal Rules, putting the objection in the answer along with the failure-to-state-a-claim objection doesn\ufffdt waive it. A defendant who chooses to answer instead of moving to dismiss in federal court must put all of his defenses in the answer, and he can raise as many as he has in that answer. He could put all seven of the Rule 12(b) defenses in there if he likes; he doesn\ufffdt have to choose one over another. So  B  is wrong. Nor is  D  correct. Hue has not waived his objection by failing to make a special appearance in the state court before removing. Removal must be done within thirty days, but can be done either before or after answering. Since Hue never responded in state court, he didn\ufffdt make a general appearance. Instead, he bumped the case into the federal court system. Since he did not do anything that would waive his objection in state court, and his case is now in federal court, federal law governs the manner in which he must raise that objection. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) says he may raise it in the answer. So what he did is fine, and  C  is the right stuff.",

            "Context": "Rule 26(b)(1): The scope of discovery. A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General . Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\ufffds claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\ufffd relative access to relevant information, the parties\ufffd resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \ufffd\ufffdany matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\ufffd\ufffd In an effort to rein in discovery, the \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to the claim or defense of any party\ufffd\ufffd language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \ufffd\ufffdthe subject matter of the pending action,\ufffd\ufffd but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \ufffd\ufffdproportionality factors\ufffd\ufffd in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to a claim or defense in the action\ufffd\ufffd standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\ufffds lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\ufffd arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is  discoverable even though it isn\ufffdt admissible as evidence at a trial. \ufffd\ufffdRelevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\ufffd\ufffd For example, statements that are \ufffd\ufffdhearsay,\ufffd\ufffd that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\ufffds a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).",
            "Question": "1. Time past and time future.  Karim sues Precision Machine Company after she suffers a serious injury to her hand using a stamping machine manufactured by Precision. Her suit is brought after the statute of limitations on a strict products liability claim has expired, so her complaint alleges negligence by Precision in the design of the machine. Karim\ufffds counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such \ufffd\ufffdsubsequent remedial measures\ufffd\ufffd is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff\ufffds injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory",

C.  would be within the scope of discovery under the earlier standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), but is not subject to discovery under the 2000 amendment to that rule. D.  is within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).",
            "Analysis": "A  is pretty much a throwaway. Rule 26(b)(1) explicitly provides that information is discoverable, even if it could not be admitted into evidence at trial, if it meets the broad relevance standard in the rule. The idea is that information might assist a party in developing her case, even though it could not be presented at trial. This is manifestly true in many cases. For example, the hearsay statement \ufffd\ufffdI heard Smith say that a Federal Express delivery man drove away after the accident\ufffd\ufffd might be inadmissible hearsay. But this information could clearly assist the plaintiff in finding an important witness. Similarly, in an assault case, evidence that a witness had heard of instances of violence by the defendant would likely be inadmissible hearsay, yet could lead to the discovery of evidence of violent conduct that could be used to impeach the defendant\ufffds testimony about who started a fight. B  rests on the assumption that events taking place after a claim arises are irrelevant to the issues in a law suit. However, such evidence frequently leads to admissible evidence relevant to the plaintiff\ufffds claim. For example, in the assault case, evidence of later assaults by a defendant would be relevant to impeach him if he testifies that the plaintiff started the quarrel. Similarly, evidence that a company consistently promoted men over women\ufffdbefore and after the plaintiff was passed over\ufffdwould assist a sex discrimination plaintiff to show a pattern of discriminatory conduct. Here, evidence that the company made its stamping machine safer after the accident is certainly relevant to the case. It suggests that the machine  can  be made safer, which may mean that they were aware of that before Karim\ufffds accident but decided, for whatever reason, not to improve it. If Karim\ufffds counsel discovers that they have added a guard, she can take depositions of Precision\ufffds engineers, to determine when they developed the design for the guard, and why it was not added before. This could lead to evidence suggesting that Precision was negligent, because it was aware of the need for the guard but delayed introducing it. Surely, this information is not only \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to the subject matter in the action\ufffd\ufffd (the Rule 26(b)(1) standard before the 2000 amendment), but also \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to the claim\ufffd\ufffd of a party (the current standard in Rule 26(b)(1)). It is relevant to Karim\ufffds claim that Precision negligently failed to act with reasonable care in designing the stamping machine. Thus,  C fails;  D  is the best answer.",

In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.",
            "Question": "2. Issues and answers.  Apex Health Care, a health care corporation, terminates the admitting privileges of Sanchetti, a surgeon at Medway General Hospital. Sanchetti sues Apex in federal court, claiming that her privileges were terminated based on sex discrimination. She claims that she has been unable to find an equivalent position, and has lost income as a result of the termination. In its answer, Apex denies that it discriminated against Sanchetti, claiming that the termination was based on poor patient care instead. It also denies that she has lost income as a result of the dismissal. Which of the following is least likely to be subject to discovery under Rule 26(b)(1)?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Apex requests Sanchetti\ufffds tax returns for the three years before and the three years since her termination. B.  Apex requests a copy of a letter Sanchetti sent to other staff doctors, complaining about medical staff salaries, and suggesting a job action to force improvements. C.  Sanchetti requests detailed information on the computer operating system and access methods for Apex\ufffds files on patient treatment. D.  Sanchetti seeks the names and addresses of all doctors and nurses at Medway General who have been disciplined over the last seven years.",
            "Analysis": "When parties send requests for discovery, they don\ufffdt include a citation or an argument as to why the requested material is within the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1). 1  The party receiving the discovery request will have to assess independently whether the requested information is relevant to a claim or defense in the case, and object if she concludes that the information is not relevant. Of course, there\ufffds nothing to prevent Apex\ufffds counsel from giving Sanchetti\ufffds counsel a call to ask why she thinks she is entitled to information that seems beyond the scope of discovery. That would frequently be the sensible thing to do. Compare Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) (party seeking to compel discovery must certify that she has conferred with the opposing party to resolve the issue before moving to compel discovery). So let\ufffds consider why the various items here might be discoverable, starting with  A . Sanchetti\ufffds tax returns should be discoverable. She has placed her income in issue by claiming that she has lost income as a result of the termination of her admitting privileges. Consequently, her income is relevant to an issue in the case, and should be subject to discovery, even though this is otherwise confidential information. Sanchetti may regard this as intrusive. It is. That\ufffds one of the prices she must pay to litigate this claim, under the broad access to information authorized by the federal discovery rules. She might convince the court to limit production to records of her  earned  income (since that is what she claims was affected by the defendant\ufffds conduct), but income information is going to be discoverable. The information sought in  C  is also relevant under Rule 26(b)(1). Here, at least some patient treatment records\ufffdthose concerning Sanchetti\ufffds patients\ufffdare placed in issue by Apex\ufffds defense that Sanchetti\ufffds privileges were terminated due to poor patient care. Consequently, information about how those records are kept and how to access them should be discoverable. The information sought in  D , concerning disciplinary actions at Medway, is also likely discoverable, even though Sanchetti has sought disciplinary files on nurses as well as doctors. It would certainly assist Sanchetti in establishing sex discrimination if she learned that Apex had frequently disciplined or discharged women but not men. Such evidence could assist Sanchetti in unearthing discriminatory actions or statements by Apex administrators that would demonstrate a policy of sex discrimination. B  is the most doubtful item under the narrower standard in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended by the 2000 amendment. This letter might be \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to the subject matter of the action\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdSanchetti\ufffds termination. Perhaps Apex really fired her because she was fomenting discontent among the staff. The letter would surely be relevant to that defense. But under the current standard in Rule 26(b)(1) the information must relate to the claims and defenses the parties  have  pleaded. It is at least questionable whether this letter has any relevance to Sanchetti\ufffds claim that her privileges were terminated based on her sex, or to Apex\ufffds defense that it was based on poor patient care. I choose  B . This suggests that the change in the relevance standard has enhanced the importance of pleading in federal cases. Had Apex pleaded its defense more generally, say, by a simple denial that it fired her based on her sex, it might have a right to broader discovery. If it simply denied the allegation of sex discrimination, it would arguably be asserting that it fired her for  some other reason . This would presumably make other reasons for her termination relevant. By specifying poor patient care as the reason for termination in its answer, Apex has arguably limited its discovery to information relevant to that \ufffd\ufffddefense.\ufffd\ufffd",
            "generated_text": "### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} Rule 26(b)(1) states that the scope of discovery includes any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and is proportional to the needs of the case.  \n{QC 2} Sanchetti claims sex discrimination in her termination, while Apex denies discrimination and claims the termination was due to poor patient care.\n{QC 3}  Proportionality factors (importance of issues, amount in controversy, access to information, party resources, importance of discovery in resolving issues, and whether burden outweighs benefit) are considered in determining the scope of discovery.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: Option A (Sanchetti's tax returns) is relevant to Apex's defense that Sanchetti hasn't suffered income loss.  This is directly relevant to a party's claim (Sanchetti's income loss claim) and defense (Apex's denial of income loss). {QC 1, QC 2}\n\nStep 2: Option B (Sanchetti's letter complaining about salaries) is arguably relevant.  While seemingly unrelated to sex discrimination or patient care at first glance, it could reveal information about Sanchetti's attitude or potential biases which might indirectly relate to the case. However, its relevance is weaker than Option A. {QC 1, QC 2}\n\nStep 3: Option C (Apex's computer system information) is less likely to be relevant.  The details of Apex's computer system are unlikely to directly relate to Sanchetti's claim of sex discrimination or Apex's defense of poor patient care. The information is likely not proportional to the needs of the case, given its tangential relationship to the core issues. {QC 1, QC 3}\n\nStep 4: Option D (names and addresses of disciplined doctors and nurses) is relevant to Sanchetti's claim.

This information is likely proportional to the needs of the case. {QC 1, QC 2}\n\nStep 5: Comparing the relevance and proportionality of all options, Option C (Apex's computer system information) is the least likely to be subject to discovery because its relevance to the claims and defenses is weak, and the burden of obtaining this information likely outweighs its benefit. {QC 1, QC 2, QC 3}\n\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer is C. {QC 1, QC 2, QC 3}\n"

        {
            "Context": "The court\ufffds role in limiting discovery: Relevance and burden. One problem with the relevance standard is that it is a matter of degree. \ufffd\ufffdThe boundaries defining information that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the action are necessarily vague and it is practically impossible to state a general rule by which they can be drawn.\ufffd\ufffd Wright & Miller \ufffd2008. Some information may be urgently relevant, some pretty relevant, and some marginally relevant, but still arguably useful in preparing a case. Without a bright-line test, there is a great deal of room for disagreement between the parties. For example, if an accident victim claims chronic back pain, his medical treatment by a back surgeon, or a chiropractor, is certainly relevant. His records of treatment by an internist probably are as well, since they may suggest other reasons for his condition. The defendant might seek discovery of the plaintiff\ufffds psychiatric records as well, on the theory that the pain may be psychosomatic rather than a result of the accident. One could even make an argument for access to the plaintiff\ufffds last five years of performance reviews at work, on the theory that job stress is the real source of his trouble. Relevance is not a yes/no proposition, but a slippery slope. Partly because of this ambiguity in the standard, Rule 26(b)(1) authorizes the court to restrict access to information even if it is relevant: Under the rule, discovery extends to relevant information \ufffd\ufffdunless otherwise limited by court order.\ufffd\ufffd Thus, the broad relevant-to-claims-or- defenses standard makes material  presumptively  discoverable, but the court has discretion to limit discovery for various reasons. For example, under the proportionality factors in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), the court may limit discovery because it is of marginal relevance, obtainable in another way, or if the burden of production outweighs the likely value of the information, in light of various practical realities about the case. And these bases for restricting discovery are not exhaustive. For example, the court may also restrict discovery of information that would be unduly intrusive on the privacy of a party, or that is sought for an improper purpose such as harassment of an opposing party. Because the relevance limit is vague, and cogent arguments can frequently be made for protecting relevant information from discovery, much is left to negotiation between counsel for the parties. If they cannot agree on the information to be produced, the party making the discovery request may move to compel production of the information, on the ground that she is entitled to it under the Rule. However, Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) requires the moving party to certify that she has conferred with the objecting party, in an effort to resolve the discovery dispute without involving the court. Conversely, the party opposing production of information may take the initiative, by moving for a protective order under Rule 26(c), barring production of the disputed information. The judge presiding over the case will then have to decide what must be produced. If she orders production of the information, she may also impose conditions to protect confidentiality of information, to avoid intimidation, or to limit the burden of responding. Generally, the model is one of broad presumptive access to information, constrained (ideally) by the common sense of counsel, and discretionary limits imposed by the judge where they are not negotiated by the parties.",

It suggests that little effort should be invested in discovery, because the plaintiff is only seeking nominal damages. While the amount in controversy is a relevant \ufffdproportionality factor\ufffd in Rule 26(b)(1), so is the \ufffd\ufffdimportance of the issues at stake in the litigation.\ufffd\ufffd Here, the plaintiff is seeking something much more important than money\ufffdvindication of a constitutional right through an injunction requiring the defendant to allow a form of religious expression. The case challenges a systemic practice, and the requested discovery seeks information about that practice. It will very likely be allowed. The discovery sought in  D  is also likely to be allowed. Information concerning complaints about other vans with the same brakes would be extremely useful to the plaintiff in making her case. It would establish that the defendant was on notice of the problem with the brakes, suggesting that it was negligent for failing to redesign them. Finding those complaints may be burdensome, but should be possible. In addition, the rules authorize the defendant to cast that burden on the plaintiff, by producing the records as kept in the course of business. Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(E)(i). The five-year period and limit to models using the disputed brakes are also reasonable. Consequently, the court will very likely allow this discovery. The information about other managers\ufffd salaries requested in  C  will also likely be allowed.  P  has alleged that she was dismissed because of her high salary relative to the other managers, so the information is relevant to her claim. It may reveal confidential information, but the court should be able to limit the intrusion in several ways. It might, for example, order production without the other managers\ufffd names. Or, it might enter a confidentiality order barring any party from revealing the information beyond its use in the litigation. If the salary information in  C  invades privacy, the request in  A   really requests intimate information. Yet it will likely be allowed.  P  has placed her sexual relations in issue by suing  D  for causing the disease. Information that  P  had relations with two other partners with the disease during the relevant period would certainly be relevant to disprove those allegations. This evidence is central to the issue in the case, yet only accessible from the plaintiff. As private as it is, the court is likely to allow the discovery, though it would almost certainly impose strict limits on its use. B  is the least likely to be granted. While the information is very important to  P,  indeed, in a sense, life or death to the case, it is not relevant to a claim or defense in the action, only to whether there\ufffds a pot of gold at the end of the lawsuit to make it worth proving the claim. Most courts have denied discovery of a defendant\ufffds assets in these circumstances, though they have allowed such discovery where punitive damages are sought. See  Moore\ufffds Federal Practice  \ufffd26.45[1][a]. Ironically, the Rules now require disclosure of insurance that may cover a claim (Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(iv)), but do not authorize this kind of inquiry into the defendant\ufffds assets.",
            "generated_text": "### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} The court has discretion to limit discovery even if the information is relevant, considering factors like marginal relevance, alternative sources, burden of production outweighing value, undue intrusiveness, and improper purpose.\n{QC 2}  Rule 26(b)(1) allows for discovery of relevant information unless limited by court order.  \n{QC 3}  The court considers proportionality when deciding on discovery requests, balancing the burden of production against the likely value of the information.\n{QC 4} A party resisting discovery can move for a protective order under Rule 26(c).\n{QC 5} The options present various discovery requests with objections raised by the responding party.\n\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: The court is least likely to order discovery when the burden of production significantly outweighs the likely value of the information, or when the request is unduly intrusive on privacy, or is for an improper purpose. {QC 1, QC 3}\n\nStep 2: Option A involves a request for information about P's sexual partners, which is highly intrusive on privacy. This strongly suggests the court would likely grant a protective order. {QC 1, QC 4, QC 5}\n\nStep 3: Option B concerns D's financial assets, which may be relevant to the case but is arguably outside the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) as it doesn't directly relate to the claims or defenses. The court might limit discovery here. {QC 1, QC 2, QC 5}\n\nStep 4: Option C involves confidential salary information of other managers. While arguably relevant, the court could limit discovery due to the privacy concerns and potential burden on D. {QC 1, QC 3, QC 5}\n\nStep 5: Option D involves a large number of dealer reports, creating a significant burden for D.  The court might limit or deny the request due to the proportionality issue (burden outweighing value). {QC 1, QC 3, QC 5}\n\nStep 6: Option E involves prisoner complaints, which are potentially relevant. However, the low monetary value of the case ($1) and the significant burden of producing five years of complaints might lead the court to limit or deny the request based on proportionality. {QC 1, QC 3, QC 5}\n\nStep 7: Comparing the options, Option A presents the strongest case for a protective order due to the high level of privacy intrusion. Option E also presents a strong case for limiting discovery due to the disproportionate burden compared to the value of the case. Options B, C, and D present varying degrees of potential for limiting discovery, but not as compellingly as A and E.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the requested discovery is least likely to be ordered in Option A, where the intrusion on privacy is significant. While Option E also presents a strong case for limiting discovery, the relevance of the information in Option E is potentially stronger than in Option A.\n\n\nStep 9: Conclusion: The court is least likely to order the discovery requested in Option A.\n"

            "Context": "Another limit: Objections based on privilege. Although discovery usually extends to all evidence relevant to claims and defenses in the action, Rule 26(b)(1) expressly carves out one limit on this: \ufffd\ufffdParties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Thus, a privilege bars production of information even though it is relevant to issues in the case. The term \ufffd\ufffdprivilege\ufffd\ufffd in the context of litigation refers to information that is protected from disclosure under the rules of evidence. The decision to recognize a privilege represents a policy judgment that maintaining the confidentiality of certain communications is so important that society is willing to sacrifice the evidentiary value of those communications to preserve that confidentiality. There are lots of privileges out there, some recognized by all states, some by most, some by a few. 2  The best known are probably the attorney-client privilege and the constitutionally based privilege against self-incrimination. For a discussion of these and other privileges, such as the physician/patient privilege, priest/penitent privilege, psychotherapist privilege, and others more arcane, see  Moore\ufffds Federal Practice  \ufffd26.49ff. If information is privileged, the party holding the privilege may refuse to testify about that communication, either in discovery or at a trial. The very meaning of privilege in this context is that the information need not be disclosed at all; obviously this purpose would be undermined if privileged information could be demanded through discovery. However, the existence of a privilege does not protect  factual information simply because it was communicated in a privileged conversation. \ufffd\ufffdThe privilege only protects from disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicate with the attorney.\ufffd\ufffd  Upjohn Co. v. United States , 449 U.S. 383, 395 (1981). Suppose, for example, that Mavroules admits to his priest in a counseling session that he feels guilty, because he knew his brakes were malfunctioning before a recent accident. If Mavroules were sued by the accident victim, and asked to answer an interrogatory concerning the condition of the brakes, he could not refuse to answer, even if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. The privilege protects the  communication itself.  Here, if Mavroules were asked whether he had told his priest that he knew his brakes were malfunctioning, he could refuse to answer if the jurisdiction recognizes a priest/penitent privilege. But the privilege does not protect facts about the litigation events themselves, simply because they were the subject of a privileged communication. If talking about the facts of a case in a privileged conversation would shield those facts from discovery, clients in litigation would be very forthcoming with their counsel: They would immediately tell their counsel everything about the case, bringing everything they know about the case within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Of course, this would eviscerate the discovery system. Nor is a privilege this broad necessary to serve the public policy goal of encouraging the protected communication. Protecting the communication itself suffices to further that policy. Thus, the privilege does not protect the underlying facts, or even the fact that a party has consulted counsel; only the content of the discussions between counsel and client is protected. Consider the application of the attorney-client privilege in the following troubling example.",
            "Question": "4. Confidential chat.  Shag, a budding rock star with no business experience, enters into a five-year exclusive contract with Fringe Records, after recording his first album with them. The album turns out to be a smash hit, and Big Money Records offers him a contract at fifteen times the paltry income called for by his contract with Fringe. Shag contacts Rivera, a lawyer, for advice. He asks Rivera if their discussion is confidential, and Rivera assures him that it is. Shag then explains the situation, and indicates that he plans to repudiate the Fringe contract, on the ground that Fringe had misrepresented the terms of the contract. Rivera asks what the misrepresentation was, and Shag admits that there wasn\ufffdt any. He admits that Jewell, Fringe\ufffds vice president, told him that the agreement was binding for five years, but that he will testify that Jewell told him it was terminable by either party at will. Rivera advises him that the contract is binding, and that he will be liable for damages if he reneges on the Fringe contract. Shag does back out, signs with Big Money, and is sued by Fringe for damages, including punitive damages for deliberately repudiating the contract. Fringe sends interrogatories to Shag (now represented by new counsel) asking (1) whether he consulted a lawyer before repudiating the contract, (2) whether he ignored his lawyer\ufffds advice when he repudiated the contract, and (3) whether Jewell told him, when he signed the Fringe contract, that it bound him to perform exclusively for Fringe for five years.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Shag will have to answer all three interrogatories, because they are all relevant to Fringe\ufffds claim that he deliberately repudiated the contract, which would support punitive damages liability. B.  Shag will have to answer the first interrogatory, but not the other two. C.  Shag will have to answer the first and second interrogatories, but not the third. D.  Shag will not have to answer any of the interrogatories, because all three were discussed in confidence with Rivera in the course of his representation. E.  None of the above is accurate.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds start by eliminating  A . It proceeds on the premise that all three items are subject to discovery, because all three are relevant to a claim in the action. If Shag contacted a lawyer, was advised that he was bound by the Fringe contract, and ignored it, that\ufffds a deliberate breach that would bolster Fringe\ufffds argument for punitive damages. It\ufffds true that all three items are relevant, but that doesn\ufffdt mean they are all subject to discovery. Under Rule 26(b)(1), all relevant information is not discoverable. That rule contains an express exception for privileged communications,  even if relevant.  Thus, a privilege bars production of information even though it is relevant. (The privilege would not be of much use if it only protected irrelevant privileged communications from disclosure!) So it is no answer to a claim of privilege that the information sought is relevant to issues in the case. D , which asserts that Shag may refuse to answer all three interrogatories, fails as well. There is no general privilege to refuse to answer discovery responses simply because you have discussed the case with counsel \ufffd\ufffdin confidence.\ufffd\ufffd As noted above, the privilege is limited to the substance of communications with counsel; the first and third interrogatories here don\ufffdt call for such communications. B  states that Shag will have to answer the first interrogatory. That is true. The cases have held that the attorney-client privilege protects the content of attorney-client communications, but not the fact that a lawyer was consulted. See, e.g.,  Howell v. Jones , 516 F.2d 53, 58 (5th Cir. 1975),  cert. denied,  424 U.S. 116 (1976). But  B  still isn\ufffdt the right answer, because it states that Shag won\ufffdt have to answer either of the other two interrogatories. Shag will have to answer the third interrogatory. It calls for Shag\ufffds personal knowledge about his discussions with Jewell. Although Shag described that conversation to Rivera, that does not provide any privilege for facts within Shag\ufffds personal knowledge. Shag may be upset when his new counsel tells him that he has to answer the third interrogatory. Shag thought he spoke to Rivera in confidence, and probably thought that whatever he told Rivera would be protected from disclosure. Not quite. The fact that he and Rivera discussed the negotiations is protected by the attorney-client privilege. Suppose that Fringe asked Shag, \ufffd\ufffdDid you tell your lawyer that Jewell told you the contract was exclusive for five years?\ufffd\ufffd Shag could refuse to answer, because that question calls for the substance of the communication between Shag and Rivera. But if he is asked, \ufffd\ufffdDid Jewell tell you that the contract was exclusive for five years?\ufffd\ufffd he has to answer that, whether he discussed it with Rivera or not. And, if he decides to bend the facts and answer \ufffd\ufffdNo,\ufffd\ufffd his new counsel (if aware of the true facts) will have to tell him he can\ufffdt be a party to untruthful discovery responses, since that would perpetrate a fraud on the court. See, e.g., ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.3(a)(3) (lawyer may not offer evidence the lawyer knows to be false). Thus, the limits of the attorney-client privilege can lead to awkward problems between client and counsel. C  states that Shag must answer the first interrogatory about consulting a lawyer and the second, which asks whether he ignored advice of counsel in repudiating the contract. This isn\ufffdt right either, because the second interrogatory asks for privileged information. There\ufffds no way he could respond to the second interrogatory without revealing the substance of the advice Rivera had given him. This is a lawyer/client communication protected by the privilege. So  E , that nasty none-of-the-above, takes the prize.",

Administering discovery objections based on privilege can be problematic. The very point of the privilege is to protect the communication from revelation. Yet how can a requesting party evaluate claims that an item is privileged without knowing the content of the document or conversation? Rule 26(b)(5) attempts to deal with this problem by requiring parties who object to production of information based on privilege to provide enough detail about the protected material to allow the requesting party to evaluate the privilege objection.

If the applicability of the privilege is challenged, the court can decide whether it is privileged based on the information required under Rule 26(b)(5)(A). In doubtful cases, the court can review documents in camera (privately, rather than in open court) to determine whether the privilege applies. If it does not, of course, discovery will be ordered.

            "Analysis": "The \ufffd\ufffdtrick of the trade\ufffd\ufffd here is not a lawyer\ufffds trick, but a trick of the professorial trade. The \ufffd\ufffddistractors\ufffd\ufffd in this question tend to distract attention from the basic point of the question. Even if a requested item is within the scope of the attorney-client privilege, that privilege must be properly asserted. General responses like \ufffd\ufffdthe plaintiff objects, not discoverable\ufffd\ufffd are inadequate under the discovery rules. Under Fed. R. Civ.

            "Context": "The meaning of \ufffd\ufffdwork product\ufffd\ufffd When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \ufffd\ufffdwork product,\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation materials.\ufffd\ufffd However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\ufffds possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\ufffds files were relevant to the opposing party\ufffds claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\ufffd practices, since they could reveal counsel\ufffds case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In  Hickman v. Taylor , 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \ufffd\ufffdattorney work product\ufffd\ufffd should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\ufffd ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\ufffds efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \ufffd\ufffdTrial Preparation: Materials\ufffd\ufffd was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman  provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \ufffd\ufffddocuments or tangible things.\ufffd\ufffd They must be \ufffd\ufffdprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\ufffd\ufffd and they must be prepared \ufffd\ufffdby or for another party or its representative. . . .\ufffd\ufffd If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\ufffds report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \ufffd\ufffddocuments or tangible things,\ufffd\ufffd and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \ufffd\ufffdprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\ufffd\ufffd They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \ufffd\ufffdsubstantial need for the materials to prepare its case\ufffd\ufffd and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.

R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2.

If the answer to both questions is \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the \ufffd\ufffdwork product doctrine,\ufffd\ufffd or the \ufffd\ufffdprotection for trial preparation material,\ufffd\ufffd rather than as a privilege. This reflects the fact that work product protection, unlike a privilege, can be outweighed, under  Hickman  or under Rule 26(b)(3), by a sufficient showing of need. But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one. Consider, in the following example, whether the material requested satisfies the Rule 26(b)(3) standard for \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation materials.\ufffd\ufffd",
            "Question": "6. Eager anticipation.  Leahy Pharmaceuticals receives a series of complaints about its \ufffd\ufffdNasa-Clean\ufffd\ufffd nasal spray. One letter, from counsel for Wallace, demands compensation for injuries Wallace allegedly sustained from using the spray, and threatens suit if compensation is not provided. Leahy officers doubt that Nasa-Clean caused Wallace\ufffds injuries. In order to determine whether to settle or litigate the claim, they ask Friedan, a chemist who works for the company, to review relevant records regarding the spray to determine whether it had caused similar injuries to other users. Friedan submits a written report on her investigation to Leahy. Four months later, Wallace brings suit in federal court against Leahy for his injuries and requests production of all documents and reports in Leahy\ufffds possession concerning problems with Nasa-Clean. Friedan\ufffds report",

B.  is not protected under Rule 26(b)(3), since it was prepared before Wallace filed suit. C.  is not protected under Rule 26(b)(3), because it was requested by Leahy, not by its counsel. D.  is not subject to discovery under Rule 26(b)(1), because it concerns injuries to other patients, not to Wallace.",
            "Analysis": "In this case, the client sought information to evaluate a claim, and asked an in-house employee to review the company\ufffds records to determine whether there was a pattern of problems that might suggest that Wallace has a valid claim. Surely, Friedan\ufffds report is relevant to Wallace\ufffds claim, so it is within the broad scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). The crucial question, then, is whether it is protected under the three-part standard for protection of \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation materials\ufffd\ufffd under Rule 26(b)(3). D  takes the position that we don\ufffdt have to decide whether the report is work product, because the report is irrelevant, since it concerns problems experienced by other patients, not by Wallace. This clearly won\ufffdt fly. Surely, it will be relevant to Wallace\ufffds claim to establish that the spray did, or did not, cause problems to other patients who used it. This would tend to establish that the problem was frequent enough to suggest an unreasonable danger, or sufficiently rare that Leahy would not have anticipated it or been required to withdraw the spray from the market. B  would deny work product protection because the report was requested and produced before suit was filed. However, Rule 26(b)(3) does not limit protection to materials created after suit is filed. It is enough if they are created \ufffd\ufffdin anticipation of litigation.\ufffd\ufffd Since Leahy has received a letter from Wallace\ufffds lawyer demanding compensation and threatening suit, it seems reasonable that they would anticipate that Wallace will sue if they don\ufffdt settle his claim. In fact, Wallace\ufffds claim is the very reason for preparing the report. This would almost certainly suffice to demonstrate anticipation of litigation. C  would deny work product protection on the ground that the report was produced for the client, not the lawyer, presumably before Leahy\ufffds counsel even entered the picture. But this too will not defeat a claim of work product protection. The Rule applies if the material is created \ufffd\ufffdby or for another party,\ufffd\ufffd which this report clearly was. Arguably, this protection is broader than  Hickman  envisioned.  Hickman  relied heavily on the importance of protecting counsel\ufffds trial preparation, but Rule 26(b)(3) extends to materials produced during the investigatory phase and by agents for the client as well as for its counsel. The Rule extends confidentiality to the entire process of claims investigation, so long as it is in anticipation of litigation. So,  A  is the best answer. The report is protected under Rule 26(b)(3), so long as the court concludes that it was prepared in anticipation of litigation. 3  Unless Wallace makes the showing of special need and inability to obtain the material in other ways, the report need not be produced. That does not, however, protect the underlying material that Friedan examined in investigating the claim. For example, Leahy could not raise a work product objection to a Request for Production of Documents seeking \ufffd\ufffdall complaints received by the defendant concerning Nasa- Clean\ufffd\ufffd for a reasonable period of time. Indeed, such a request would likely be a reasonable alternative way of getting the information in Friedan\ufffds report, which suggests that Wallace would be unable to overcome the presumptive protection of Rule 26(b)(3).",

            "Context": "The meaning of \ufffd\ufffdwork product\ufffd\ufffd When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \ufffd\ufffdwork product,\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation materials.\ufffd\ufffd However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\ufffds possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\ufffds files were relevant to the opposing party\ufffds claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\ufffd practices, since they could reveal counsel\ufffds case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In  Hickman v. Taylor , 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \ufffd\ufffdattorney work product\ufffd\ufffd should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\ufffd ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\ufffds efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \ufffd\ufffdTrial Preparation: Materials\ufffd\ufffd was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman  provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \ufffd\ufffddocuments or tangible things.\ufffd\ufffd They must be \ufffd\ufffdprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\ufffd\ufffd and they must be prepared \ufffd\ufffdby or for another party or its representative. . . .\ufffd\ufffd If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\ufffds report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \ufffd\ufffddocuments or tangible things,\ufffd\ufffd and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \ufffd\ufffdprepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\ufffd\ufffd They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \ufffd\ufffdsubstantial need for the materials to prepare its case\ufffd\ufffd and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \ufffd\ufffdthe mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\ufffds attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is \ufffd\ufffdyes,\ufffd\ufffd it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ.

But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one. Here\ufffds a question that requires careful application of Rule 26(b)(3).",
            "Question": "7. Presumptuous presumptions.  Mason sues Drake in federal court for negligently causing a fire in her warehouse in Boston. A week after the fire, Mason\ufffds attorney locates and interviews Collins, who was drinking wine behind the warehouse at the time of the fire. Collins says he and Engels saw someone who looked like Drake speed away from the fire just after it began. Mason\ufffds counsel made an audio recording of the interview with Collins. Collins lives in Boston, within the district in which the suit is pending. Drake\ufffds attorney had asked Collins to come in to discuss the case informally with him, but Collins refused. Drake serves interrogatories on Mason asking Mason to \ufffd\ufffdstate the names of any witnesses who may have knowledge of the events giving rise to this action.\ufffd\ufffd He also sends a request for documents, which requires Mason to \ufffd\ufffdproduce any statements you or your attorney have from any witness regarding the cause of the fire.\ufffd\ufffd Mason\ufffds counsel responds by objecting to both the interrogatory and the request on the ground of \ufffd\ufffdwork product.\ufffd\ufffd Which of the following statements is true?",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Mason may refuse to answer the interrogatory and to produce the tape, based on the work product doctrine. B.  Mason must answer the interrogatory, and will have to produce the tape of the interview, since Drake can make the showing required under Rule 26(b)(3) to overcome the protection for work product materials. C.  Mason must answer the interrogatory, but the request for production of the tape is probably protected from disclosure under Rule 26(b)(3). D.  Mason must produce the tape under Rule 26(b)(3)(C), because it contains the statement of a witness.",
            "Analysis": "Drake has requested two items: the names of witnesses to the litigation events and the statement of one witness taken by opposing counsel. Let\ufffds consider the witness list first. Mason\ufffds counsel cannot protect the names of witnesses he is aware of simply because he learned of them in the course of trial preparation. But why not? Isn\ufffdt this \ufffd\ufffdwork product,\ufffd\ufffd in the sense that he unearthed the names of these witnesses through his trial preparation efforts? Well, in a sense this is \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation material\ufffd\ufffd; it is information Mason\ufffds counsel has learned in the course of preparing the case. However, the protection does not apply to everything an attorney knows or learns. It applies, under Rule 26(b)(3) to \ufffd\ufffddocuments and tangible things\ufffd\ufffd created during trial preparation, and attorneys\ufffd strategic musings, but not to the facts those documents contain. Even though Mason\ufffds counsel discovered these facts himself while developing his case, this will not shield the information from discovery. Mason\ufffds lawyer is his agent, and his knowledge of facts about the case will be attributed to Mason. Thus, when Mason answers the interrogatory (and it is the client, not the lawyer, who signs the answers), he will have to include responsive information developed by his lawyer about the case. So  A  is wrong; Mason must answer the interrogatory requesting the names of relevant witnesses. The other choices consider whether Rule 26(b)(3) protects the witness statement from discovery.  D  takes the view that it must be produced under Rule 26(b)(3)(C), which deals specifically with witness statements. This is too loose a reading of the subsection, however. This provision allows a party to obtain  her own  statement about the case. It also allows a nonparty to obtain  her own  statement. It does not apply where a party seeks a statement of a nonparty. So is it  B  or  C ? Since Collins\ufffds statement was taken during the course of trial preparation by Mason\ufffds counsel, it enjoys protection under the work product doctrine, unless that presumptive protection is overcome under Rule 26(b)(3). The presumption is not likely to be overcome here. Drake will not likely be able to show that he could not obtain substantially equivalent information in another way. Collins lives in Boston. Although he refused an informal interview, he presumably can be subpoenaed for a deposition to obtain his testimony. Thus, the presumptive protection of the Rule is not overcome.  C  is the better answer.",

If the information sought is protected, it will have to be under the work product doctrine, not attorney-client privilege. But Rule 26(b)(3), by its terms, does not provide such protection. It extends work product protection to \ufffd\ufffddocuments and tangible things.\ufffd\ufffd The questions here seek oral testimony concerning Sanders\ufffds conversations with Marathon\ufffds counsel, so the rule does not apply.  B  is wrong. Although Rule 26(b)(3) doesn\ufffdt apply,  E , which takes the position that the objection should be overruled, is not the best answer either. The case law has held that Rule 26(b)(3) has  partially  codified the work product protection recognized in  Hickman . It governs where the material sought to be protected is found in documents or tangible things. But, where similar work product information  not  included in a document or tangible thing is sought, the cases look back to  Hickman  and extend similar protection to the material. In other words, Rule 26(b)(3) is not the exclusive source of work product protection. Attorneys\ufffd mental processes can still be protected under the common law protection stemming from Hickman  as well. So, we\ufffdre down to  C  and  D .  C  asserts that the material is protected, but that the protection can be overcome if DeMarco makes a showing similar to that required under Rule 26(b)(3): that he really needs it and can\ufffdt get equivalent information any other way.

            "Context": "Automatic disclosure under the Federal Rules Most discovery is initiated by counsel for the litigants, who send interrogatories and requests for production of documents to opposing parties and schedule depositions of witnesses. However, Rule 26(a) also requires \ufffd\ufffdautomatic disclosure\ufffd\ufffd of certain categories of information\ufffd that is, an exchange of this information among the parties without a request for it from another party. Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases 1  are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose \ufffd the identity of individuals \ufffd\ufffdlikely to have discoverable information\ufffdalong with the subjects of that information\ufffdthat the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information) and things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses \ufffd a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based \ufffd any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery.

P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information  that the disclosing party may use  to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness\ufffds testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness\ufffds testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party \ufffd\ufffdmay use to support its claims or defenses.\ufffd\ufffd Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal  supporting  evidence, but not adverse evidence.

Fremont Publishing Company sues New Era Press for publishing a story about a shipwreck that it claims duplicated a copyrighted story from one of its books. New Era denies that Fremont held the copyright to the story. Shortly after the parties make their disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1), New Era\ufffds lawyers learn that Fremont had received a letter a year earlier from an individual claiming that he held the copyright on the shipwreck story and demanding compensation from Fremont for using it. Fremont had not disclosed the existence of this letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures. New Era",
            "Options": "Options: A.  should move for sanctions under Rule 37(c)(1) for Fremont\ufffds failure to disclose the letter in its Rule 26(a) disclosures. B.  should move to require supplemental disclosure of the letter, under Rules 26(a)(1) and 26(e)(1). C.  should send Fremont a Rule 34 Request for Production of documents to obtain the letter. D.  cannot obtain the letter, because it is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a).",
            "Analysis": "In this example, Fremont evidently had the document but failed to include it in its initial disclosure. New Era learns that it exists and was left out. What should it do? B  seems like a sensible course, to move for further disclosure, since the letter was not produced. This isn\ufffdt likely to be granted, however, because the letter probably does not have to be disclosed. Rule 26(a)(1) (A)(ii) requires disclosure of documents the disclosing party \ufffd\ufffdmay use to support its claims or defenses.\ufffd\ufffd It hardly seems that Fremont will use this letter, challenging the validity of its copyright, to support its claim against New Era for infringing that copyright. If the letter was not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii), the court is not going to order it disclosed in response to New Era\ufffds motion. For the same reason, the motion for sanctions suggested in  A  isn\ufffdt going to be granted: Fremont would not be sanctioned for failure to disclose the letter if it was not required to disclose it. D  suggests that New Era cannot obtain the letter, since it is not within the scope of disclosure under Rule 26(a). While the letter very probably is not subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a), that does not mean that New Era cannot obtain it through discovery. It only means that Fremont does not have to  disclose it automatically  at the outset of the case. It is still discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1), which allows parties to obtain discovery of information \ufffd\ufffdrelevant to the claim or defense of any party\ufffd\ufffd in the action. Surely, the letter is relevant to New Era\ufffds defense that Fremont did not have a copyright on the story. Consequently, it is subject to discovery under the broad standard of relevance in Rule 26(b)(1). So C  is the best answer: New Era is entitled to obtain this letter through the traditional discovery devices and may send Fremont a request for production of the letter under Rule 34. This illustrates that a party cannot rely on disclosure as a substitute for discovery. Disclosure will only reveal information favorable to the other party (that it may \ufffd\ufffduse to support its claims or defenses\ufffd\ufffd). To obtain information that is unfavorable to Fremont, New Era must ask for it using the traditional discovery devices.",

            "Context": "Automatic disclosure under the Federal Rules Most discovery is initiated by counsel for the litigants, who send interrogatories and requests for production of documents to opposing parties and schedule depositions of witnesses. However, Rule 26(a) also requires \ufffd\ufffdautomatic disclosure\ufffd\ufffd of certain categories of information\ufffd that is, an exchange of this information among the parties without a request for it from another party. Rule 26(a) requires three categories of disclosures: initial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(1); disclosure of expert testimony (Rule 26(a)(2)), and pre-trial disclosures (Rule 26(a)(3)). We will focus on initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1), which takes place at the outset of the case. Under Rule 26(a)(1), parties in most federal cases 1  are required to exchange four categories of information at the outset of the case, without a request from the other side. They must disclose \ufffd the identity of individuals \ufffd\ufffdlikely to have discoverable information\ufffdalong with the subjects of that information\ufffdthat the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd copies or descriptions of documents (including electronically stored information) and things in the possession, custody, or control of the disclosing party that the party may use to support its claims or defenses \ufffd a computation of damages claimed, making available for inspection and copying the documents and other materials on which the computation is based \ufffd any insurance agreement under which an insurer may be liable to satisfy all or part of a judgment in the action The parties are also required to meet and confer about these disclosures and other discovery issues and to file a written report with the court outlining their plans for discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f). Until this meeting takes place, the parties are barred from taking discovery by other means (such as interrogatories, requests for documents, or depositions). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1). Note several points about the disclosure requirements. They do not require a party to reveal all witnesses she knows of, but only those likely to have information  that the disclosing party may use  to support its claims or defenses. If a party knows of a witness she will definitely not use, that witness need not be listed. Of course, if the party has any doubt as to whether she will use the witness\ufffds testimony, she would likely disclose the witness. If she does not, Rule 37(c)(1) will likely bar the party who failed to make the disclosure from using that witness\ufffds testimony at trial. The same principle applies to automatic disclosure of documents and things. The rule requires production of documents the party \ufffd\ufffdmay use to support its claims or defenses.\ufffd\ufffd Here again, the Rule requires a party to reveal  supporting  evidence, but not adverse evidence. This avoids placing counsel in the position of having to review all known evidence, locate all documents that might support the  other party\ufffds  case, and hand them over without a request. In some cases, Rule 26(a)(1) may call for disclosure of a document as to which a party claims a privilege or that constitutes work product. Rule 26(a) does not expressly authorize a disclosing party to object to disclosure based on the attorney-client privilege or work product protection. What should a party do if she has information subject to disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) but arguably subject to such protection? In analyzing the question below, consider Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) and Rule 26(b)(5)(A). The latter requires a party who objects to discovery based on a \ufffd\ufffdprivilege or protection\ufffd\ufffd to \ufffd\ufffddescribe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed\ufffdand do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.\ufffd\ufffd",
            "Question": "2. Disclosure and protection.  Roberge sues Casteneda for injuries in an auto accident. Casteneda meets with her defense counsel, Darrow, and explains that Roberge caused the accident by running a red light. She indicates that Quinn, a bystander who witnessed the accident, will corroborate her version of the facts. Darrow interviews Quinn and drafts an affidavit for Quinn to sign, stating under oath his testimony that Roberge ran the light and drove into Casteneda. He obtains the affidavit in order to use it in support of an early motion for summary judgment. A week later Darrow\ufffds Rule 26(a) disclosures are due.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Darrow will violate Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) if he fails to disclose Quinn\ufffds affidavit. B.  Darrow need not disclose the affidavit, because it is not within the definition of documents to be disclosed under Rule 26(a)(1). C.  Darrow need not disclose the affidavit, because he does not plan to use it at trial. D.  Darrow need not disclose the document, but should describe the nature of the affidavit in his disclosure response and object to disclosing it based on work product protection.",
            "Analysis": "In this example, the affidavit was prepared by Darrow in anticipation of litigation. This \ufffd\ufffdtrial preparation\ufffd\ufffd material is protected from discovery by Rule 26(b)(3). Is it also protected from automatic disclosure? B  is probably wrong, since Quinn\ufffds affidavit fits the definition in Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). It is a document in Casteneda\ufffds possession that she may use to support her defense that she was not negligent in causing the accident\ufffdindeed, she created the document for that purpose. Even though the document was created by counsel, it still seems to fit the Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) definition, since Darrow plans to use it to support Casteneda\ufffds defense. C  is also a weak answer. While Darrow does not plan to use the affidavit at trial, she does plan to use it in support of the motion for summary judgment. Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) requires disclosure of documents the party \ufffd\ufffdmay use to support its claims or defenses.\ufffd\ufffd The Advisory Committee Note confirms that materials that will be used to support a pre-trial motion, as well as those that will be used at trial, must be disclosed. Advisory Committee Note to 2000 Amendment (note on Subdivision (a)(1)). A  states that Darrow must disclose the document. But this document is work product, since it was created by Casteneda\ufffds counsel in preparation of her case, which would ordinarily be protected from discovery under Rule 26(b)(3). It seems doubtful that it should enjoy any lesser protection from disclosure at the outset of the case. When Darrow files it in court with a summary judgment motion, the affidavit will lose work product protection, since filing makes the document public. But Casteneda would still prefer not to produce the affidavit at the outset, since she is not sure that she will use it at all. A careful reading of the Rules suggests that she should reveal the existence of the affidavit, but assert the work product protection to protect it from disclosure. There is no reason why the doctrine should bar production of work product through regular discovery, but not through disclosure. And a careful reading of Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) indicates that Darrow may comply with it by disclosing  a description by category and location  of the affidavit. At the same time, Darrow may object to producing it based on work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5) confirms this. It requires the objecting party to describe the nature of the documents, communications, or things  not produced or disclosed \ufffdand do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection. [emphasis added] The reference to materials \ufffd\ufffdnot produced or disclosed\ufffd\ufffd certainly suggests that a party may resist disclosure as well as discovery based on work product protection. This reading makes sense and makes  D  the best answer. It provides the opposing party with information about relevant documents in the hands of her adversary, but in a way that preserves the protection of the work product doctrine. Roberge will still learn that Quinn has relevant evidence, because, under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(i), Darrow will have to disclose that Quinn is a witness she may use to support Casteneda\ufffds defense. The identity of a witness, even if discovered through counsel\ufffds own efforts, is not protected work product.",

Build-Rite Construction Company and Xifares Construction Company engaged in a joint venture for the construction of an apartment building, agreeing to share the profits equally after payment of all expenses. Build-Rite later sues Xifares for an accounting, claiming that Xifares has overstated its expenses on the project and reported smaller profits than it actually realized on the venture. Three months after initial disclosures were exchanged, counsel for Xifares discovers an itemization of its construction expenses on the apartment building. Xifares\ufffds employees had searched for relevant documents but this itemization had been misfiled with forms for another Xifares project, and it was missed. When he discovers the itemization, Xifares\ufffds counsel forgets to disclose it to opposing counsel. Six months later, and three months before the date for trial, Xifares\ufffds counsel is organizing exhibits and realizes that he has not disclosed it. Xifares\ufffds counsel will probably want to use the itemization, which supports its position, at trial.",

            "Analysis": "This question considers the consequences of making an incomplete initial disclosure of the evidence described in Rule 26(a)(1). Xifares failed to disclose the expense itemization at the outset of the case because its employees made a reasonable investigation but missed it. Rule 26 contemplates that this may happen, since it requires supplementation where a disclosure is \ufffd\ufffdincomplete or incorrect.\ufffd\ufffd Surely, Xifares will not be forever barred from using the evidence based on this good faith mistake. Thus  B  suggests too drastic a penalty for the initial failure to disclose. However, when Xifares\ufffds counsel became aware of the document, Rule 26(e)(1) required him to make a supplemental disclosure, since he has learned that \ufffd\ufffdthe information disclosed is incomplete or incorrect.\ufffd\ufffd Clearly the drafters intended parties to supplement their disclosures in light of their evolving knowledge of the witnesses and documents in the case. See the Advisory Committee note to the 1993 amendments, which provides that \ufffd\ufffdsupplementation need not be made as each new item of information is learned but should be made at appropriate intervals during the discovery period. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Since Xifares\ufffds counsel may want to use the itemization to support its claims, it should have sent a supplemental disclosure including the itemization or a description of it.  A , which suggests that later disclosure is not required, so long as a reasonable search was made initially, is off the mark. That leaves us to choose between  C  and  D . C  states that Xifares will be barred from using the itemization since it has not been disclosed in a timely manner. Yet it is doubtful that the rule leads inexorably to that conclusion or that a practical judge would so rule. Although Rule 37(c)(1) provides that the party who failed to make disclosure may be barred from using the information, it also provides alternative, lesser sanctions where such a drastic sanction is not warranted. Here, the information won\ufffdt be barred if the failure to disclose it was harmless (as it would be, for example, if the opposing party already knew of it). If the failure to disclose did affect Build-Rite\ufffds trial preparation, some sanction less than a blanket exclusion of the document is likely warranted. The failure to disclose was inadvertent. Discovery is not yet complete in the case, so disclosure at this point should provide Build-Rite an adequate opportunity to develop its case in response to the itemization.

While disclosure was added to the discovery rules in 1993, interrogatories, depositions, and requests for production of documents have been available under the Federal Rules since their adoption in 1938. Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party\ufffds lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \ufffd\ufffdeach act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\ufffd\ufffd This is not a purely factual question, like \ufffd\ufffdPlease state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\ufffd\ufffd Instead, such \ufffd\ufffdcontention interrogatories\ufffd\ufffd call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time.

Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \ufffd\ufffdeach act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\ufffd\ufffd This is not a purely factual question, like \ufffd\ufffdPlease state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\ufffd\ufffd Instead, such \ufffd\ufffdcontention interrogatories\ufffd\ufffd call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. The general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients\ufffd interests. But in one respect they can be more effective than depositions. An interrogatory to a corporate party requires the party \ufffd\ufffdto furnish such information as is  available to the party, \ufffd\ufffd (emphasis added) not just information that the person answering them personally knows. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5). This emphasizes that it is the lawyers who interpose legal objections to discovery (and, consequently, may be sanctioned if such objections are not justified). Which is the proper response to the interrogatory below?",
            "Question": "5. Reasonable inquiry.  Melchior brings a products liability action in federal court against Atmosphere Aviation Corporation, a national airline. She seeks damages for personal injuries suffered in the crash of an Atmosphere plane. She also sues General Engines Corporation, which manufactured the engines on the plane. General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation. While Branch oversees all General\ufffds operations, she does not have all the information sought by the interrogatory; much of it is located in files in offices at other corporate locations. Branch should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  conduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has, and answer based on that investigation. B.  respond by listing whatever documents she has in her own files about accidents involving the engine. C.  object to the interrogatory, because the information sought is covered by the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1)(B). D.  not respond to the interrogatory, since it is not sent by an opposing party.",
            "Analysis": "This interrogatory calls for information located in various offices in five locations. Doubtless, Branch, when she receives the interrogatory, would not be able, of her own knowledge, to specify how many documents fit the description in the interrogatory, or perhaps even which employees have such documents. The only way to find out is to conduct an investigation, which may require considerable effort by numerous General Engines employees. Let\ufffds dispose of  D  first. It states that Branch should not respond, since the interrogatories were sent by a codefendant, not by the plaintiff. This would be bad advice for several reasons.  First , ignoring interrogatories is not one of the options under the Rule, even if you think they are improper. If the receiving party has objections to the interrogatories, she should respond with those objections, not drop them in the circular file.  Second , the rule authorizes interrogatories to \ufffd\ufffdany other party\ufffd\ufffd (Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a)(1)), so the interrogatory is not objectionable on this basis anyway. The argument for  C  is interesting. The initial disclosure requirements in Rule 26(a)(1) mandate disclosure of documents about the case. Since that rule covers the ground, why should a party be required to answer an interrogatory on the same point? It\ufffds a nice argument, but doesn\ufffdt fly. Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii) requires a party to disclose the documents that it \ufffd\ufffdmay use to support its claims and defenses,\ufffd\ufffd not all documents it has concerning issues in the case. Indeed, the documents other parties will be most interested in probably won\ufffdt be disclosed, since they are likely to be adverse to the disclosing party and therefore would not be \ufffd\ufffdused to support [that party\ufffds] claims or defenses.\ufffd\ufffd Rule 26(b)(1), which authorizes discovery of any information relevant to a claim or defense of any party, clearly permits interrogatories seeking information about such documents, including information adverse to that party. This is true, even though some relevant documents will be disclosed under Rule 26(a)(1). Indeed, parties will almost always send interrogatories or document requests that partially duplicate the disclosure requirements, since they will want  all  the documents, not just those favorable to the other side. So, it seems that Branch will have to answer the interrogatory. The remaining question is whether she should do so based on the information she personally has ( B ), or must go beyond that to gather information available throughout the company (as  A  suggests). Rule 33(b)(1)(B) provides that a party must respond to interrogatories by providing \ufffd\ufffdthe information available to the party.\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffdThe party\ufffd\ufffd here is General Engines, not Branch. Thus the Rule requires that Branch determine what documents the company has concerning such accidents, and respond based on that investigation. See generally Wright & Miller \ufffd2174. Choose  A . You can imagine how enthusiastic Branch will be about conducting that investigation. At the very least, it is a major distraction from her job; at worst, it can be an enormous burden leading to production of lots of damaging evidence. In some cases, interrogatories may be objectionable on the ground that the burden of responding is too great or that they require the responding party to conduct analyses or gather information that the requesting party should obtain itself. But here, the request probably is not unduly burdensome, since the interrogatory describes precisely the documents to be listed, and there are not likely to be huge numbers of such reports.",

            "Context": "Requests for production of documents under Rule 34 Perhaps the most intrusive of the discovery tools is the request for production of documents. Rule 34 allows parties to request production of documents from other parties that are relevant to claims and defenses in the case. The request must describe the categories of documents sought with \ufffd\ufffdreasonable particularity.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(1)(A). A request for \ufffd\ufffdall documents relevant to the plaintiff\ufffds claims against the defendant\ufffd\ufffd would be too broad, but it is permissible to describe the requested documents by category (Rule 34(b)(1)(A)), such as \ufffd\ufffdall documents relevant to the plaintiff\ufffds medical treatment from the date of the accident to the date of this request.\ufffd\ufffd Requests for production require a party to open its files, to provide other parties access to documents that are otherwise confidential and may be damaging to the producing party\ufffds case. It is indeed intrusive. It isn\ufffdt surprising that parties\ufffdespecially corporations with extensive operations and complex filing and computer systems\ufffdfrequently view such discovery as unwarranted. It can be extremely burdensome to comply with even a narrowly crafted request for production, and may interfere significantly with corporate operations. Rule 34 provides one means of limiting this burden. Rule 34(b)(1)(E) (i) authorizes a party to comply with a Rule 34 request by producing the relevant documents as kept in the usual course of business. Thus, a corporation could simply make its files available to the requesting party, and let the requesting party do the work of culling through them for relevant documents. This course has several problems, however.  First , it provides the other party with wide access to files, both relevant and irrelevant. There is likely to be information in the files that the producing party would prefer to keep confidential, and that would not be within the scope of the Rule 34 request.  Second , allowing access to the files waives the producing party\ufffds objection to production of documents that are protected from discovery. For example, allowing the other side to review files that contain documents that are privileged or enjoy work product protection will waive the privilege or protection. Nor would opening the files to the other side save the responding party much effort. The responding party will have to review those files anyway, in order to prepare for trial and to determine what documents the other side has found. Consequently, when a request is made, the producing party is likely to take the alternative course available under Rule 34: to cull through its files, extract relevant documents, \ufffd\ufffdorganize and label them to correspond to the categories in the request,\ufffd\ufffd (Fed.

            "Question": "6. A matter of opinion.  Paragon Corporation is involved in litigation with Omniplex Corporation, which alleges that Paragon breached its contract to supply Omniplex with wiring assemblies for its high-speed printing presses. In particular, the parties dispute the meaning of a clause that requires Paragon to \ufffd\ufffdsupply Omniplex\ufffds needs for wiring assemblies for the period of the contract.\ufffd\ufffd Omniplex argues that this requires Paragon to supply as many assemblies as Omniplex requires. Paragon argues that it only requires them to supply the number Omniplex was using yearly when the contract was made. Paragon receives a Request for Production of Documents under Rule 34 seeking \ufffd\ufffdall documents relating to the drafting, negotiation, or execution of the contract in issue in this litigation.\ufffd\ufffd At its counsel\ufffds request, Paragon officers order a search of the files for documents responsive to the request.

The memo questions whether Paragon should accept this provision, since \ufffd\ufffdI read this language in the agreement to commit Paragon to supplying  all  of Omniplex\ufffds requirements for wiring assemblies for five years, regardless of conditions in the market or alternative opportunities with other customers.\ufffd\ufffd",

            "Analysis": "Perhaps a few students, imbued with the concept that litigation means a scorched-earth defense of the client\ufffds cause at all costs, would choose  E . This is understandable. Once you represent a client, you naturally identify with that client\ufffds interests, and producing this document is clearly going to adversely affect Paragon\ufffds defense. But Rule 34 contains no exception for documents likely to hurt the producing party\ufffds case. If it did, there\ufffdd be little point in using the rule! It requires production of all relevant documents, favorable and unfavorable, unless the producing party has a valid objection. So ignoring the document\ufffdor, worse, destroying it\ufffdwould be a clear violation of Paragon\ufffds obligation under Rule 34, which, if discovered, would subject it to potentially severe sanctions under Rule 37. A lawyer advising such a course would violate both the Rules of Civil Procedure and applicable rules of professional conduct, and possibly even criminal statutes. Nor would Paragon be likely to \ufffd\ufffdget away with it.\ufffd\ufffd Paragon employees who received the memo will likely be deposed. Unless they are willing to commit perjury, they are likely to testify to the existence of the memo, making its absence extremely awkward. If they are deposed, the document would likely be subpoenaed in conjunction with the deposition. Unless all these employees are willing to violate their obligations to testify truthfully under oath, the memo is going to surface. Thus, ignoring its existence would be an unwise as well as an unethical course. D  is also wrong. Nothing in the discovery rules suggests that documents stating opinions are exempt from discovery. Perhaps the memo would not be admissible, at least for the truth of the statement about the meaning of the contract provision. 2  But admissibility and discoverability  are two different concepts. \ufffd\ufffdInformation within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Here, for example, production of this document would likely lead Omniplex to take the contracts administrator\ufffds deposition, which clearly could lead to admissible evidence. Moving on up the line,  C  also fails. It is hard to think of any reasonable interpretation of the document request that does not encompass this document. Although it involves internal debate at Paragon about the contract, it certainly does relate to the negotiation of the contract. And  B  fails as well. This document was not drafted in anticipation of litigation; it was in the normal course of business. So,  A  is the best answer. Painful as it may be, Paragon will have to produce this document.

            "Context": "Problems posed by electronic discovery In large scale litigation these days, many problems are posed by the fact that the \ufffd\ufffddocuments\ufffd\ufffd parties need are in electronic form. \ufffd\ufffdIt is estimated that over 90 percent of all business information is created electronically and never printed out.\ufffd\ufffd 4  Computers have facilitated the creation, storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information. When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: \ufffd Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that \ufffd\ufffdelectronically stored information\ufffd\ufffd is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it\ufffds clear now that it is. \ufffd Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is \ufffd\ufffdnot reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.\ufffd\ufffd The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. \ufffd Rule 37\ufffdwhich addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in  discovery\ufffdexpressly  addresses  failure  to  preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders\ufffd such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator\ufffds claim. \ufffd Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an \ufffd\ufffdinadvertent disclosure\ufffd\ufffd to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party\ufffds claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision.",

            "Context": "A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness\ufffds attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They \ufffd\ufffdget the witness on the record.\ufffd\ufffd That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness\ufffds deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the  other side\ufffds  witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness\ufffds testimony or counsel\ufffds line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent\ufffds testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party\ufffds testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness\ufffds testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness\ufffds testimony, not the opposing party. Consider what the plaintiff\ufffds counsel should do in the following scenario.",
            "Question": "9. Your witness.  Czonka is fired from his job at fifty-nine, after twenty-one years with NorthStar Corporation. He sues in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), claiming that he was fired based on his age. Two months after filing suit, Czonka\ufffds counsel learns that Roh, one of his supervisors at NorthStar, has just retired, and is about to move to South Korea. Although discovery has just begun, NorthStar has noticed Roh\ufffds deposition. Czonka\ufffds counsel should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  prepare as fully as possible for the deposition, and cross-examine Roh as if she were doing so at trial. B.  object and move for a protective order under Rule 26(c), on the ground that discovery has just begun, so that she is not yet prepared to cross-examine Roh at the deposition. C.  attend the deposition, but not cross-examine Roh, if Roh is willing to talk privately to her about the case. D.  object on the ground that Roh cannot be deposed, since Roh is not a party to the case.",
            "Analysis": "The usual purpose of the deposition is to gather information, or to pin down the opposing party\ufffds witnesses on the record. But that isn\ufffdt the purpose of  this  deposition. Here, NorthStar has noticed the deposition of Roh, a former supervisor who is likely to be \ufffd\ufffdtheir\ufffd\ufffd witness, in the sense that he is likely to testify favorably to them. (If he were likely to testify unfavorably to NorthStar, they would presumably allow him to disappear undeposed.) Clearly, they have decided to take his deposition because he may not be available for trial. If he is unavailable, they plan to use his deposition testimony at trial instead, as Rule 32(a)(4)(B) allows. The fact that Roh\ufffds deposition is likely to be used at trial changes the equation. At such a \ufffd\ufffdtrial deposition,\ufffd\ufffd NorthStar will be conducting direct examination of Roh, their own witness, as they would at trial, and Czonka\ufffds counsel had better be prepared to cross-examine Roh just as though she were doing so at trial. However, since the deposition is being conducted so early, Czonka\ufffds counsel is not fully ready to do so. Let\ufffds dispose quickly of  D . Rule 30(a)(1) authorizes taking the deposition of \ufffd\ufffdany person, including a party.\ufffd\ufffd Roh isn\ufffdt a party, but he is a person, so he may be deposed. As the introduction states, the lawyer who did not notice the deposition (said to be \ufffd\ufffddefending the deposition\ufffd\ufffd) usually does not cross-examine extensively at a deposition, if she can discuss the case privately with the witness. But  C  is wrong here, because the deposition is being taken to perpetuate the witness\ufffds testimony for trial, not to obtain information. If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka\ufffds counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. On this logic,  A  is the best answer. Czonka\ufffds counsel could move for a protective order postponing the deposition till later in discovery, as  B  suggests. But she isn\ufffdt likely to succeed if Roh is about to leave the country. Once he\ufffds gone, he\ufffds gone. He no longer works for NorthStar, so it could not make him return for trial. Consequently, the judge is not likely to prevent the taking of his deposition, even though it leaves Czonka at a disadvantage.",

            "Context": "Instructions not to answer at a deposition While depositions produce sworn testimony, they are not taken in front of a judge. They are usually taken in the office of the lawyer taking the deposition. A court reporter, hired privately by deposing counsel, swears the witness and records the testimony. The testimony is then transcribed and provided to counsel for each party. Counsel for all parties are entitled to attend the deposition, and usually do. An interesting problem arises if the deponent\ufffds lawyer has objections to the deposing counsel\ufffds questions. Since there\ufffds no judge present to rule on objections, what happens? Several provisions of Rule 30 address this problem. Rule 30(c)(2) provides: An objection at the time of the examination\ufffdwhether to evidence, to a party\ufffds conduct, to the officer\ufffds qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition\ufffdmust be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. That rule further provides that \ufffd\ufffdA person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).\ufffd\ufffd Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted \ufffd\ufffdin bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.\ufffd\ufffd Under these provisions, the deponent\ufffds counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (\ufffd\ufffdthe examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdFed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the  use of evidence at trial , not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained. How about this case?",
            "Question": "10. Gag order.

The question asks for inadmissible hearsay and for irrelevant information, since it pertains to commercial loans, not residential loans.

P. 30(c)(2) the Bank\ufffds counsel should object, with the testimony being taken subject to the objection.",
            "Analysis": "As the introduction indicates, it is not usually appropriate to instruct a witness not to answer deposition questions based on an objection to the evidence. For example, it is improper to instruct a witness not to answer a question on the ground that it is irrelevant, as  B suggests. If the questioning were abusive (\ufffd\ufffdHow many times have you beaten your wife?\ufffd\ufffd), the proper response would be to suspend the deposition to present a motion to the court, under Rule 30(d)(3), on the ground that the deposition is being conducted \ufffd\ufffdin a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent.\ufffd\ufffd Similarly, it is improper to instruct a witness not to answer on the ground that the evidence the question calls for would be inadmissible at trial. First, evidence is discoverable whether or not admissible at trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1): \ufffd\ufffdInformation within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\ufffd\ufffd Second, under Rule 30(c)(2) it is not permissible to instruct the witness not to answer, except for three purposes: to preserve a privilege, to enforce a court- ordered limitation on discovery, or to present a motion for a protective order to the court. So  A  fails as well. So the proper response must be  C  or  D .  C  states that counsel could instruct the witness not to answer if the question calls for information that constitutes work product. Rule 30(c)(2) authorizes counsel to instruct a witness not to answer in order to \ufffd\ufffdpreserve a privilege.\ufffd\ufffd So the question is whether a work product objection is based on a \ufffd\ufffdprivilege.\ufffd\ufffd Work product is often referred to as a \ufffd\ufffdprotection\ufffd\ufffd rather than a privilege. But interpretation of Rule 30(c)(2) here should turn on the policy underlying that subsection, not on the terminology. The rationale for allowing instructions not to answer questions that call for privileged information is that the information should be protected from disclosure  at all , not just from use at trial. Based on this rationale, counsel should be able to instruct a deponent not to answer a question that would reveal work product information as well, because work product is protected from pre-trial disclosure unless a showing of substantial need is made. Here, the question calls not only for the fact of Zervos\ufffds investigation, but for the results, which is probably protected work product. Thus,  C  seems like the best answer. If the question calls for information protected as work product, it is proper to instruct the deponent not to answer, under Rule 30(c)(2). 5",

Defendant's counsel instructed the witness not to answer.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: The defendant's counsel's instruction to the witness not to answer is permissible only if it falls under one of the exceptions in Rule 30(c)(2) {QC 1}.  These exceptions are to preserve a privilege, enforce a court order, or present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).\n\nStep 2: The objection is based on hearsay, irrelevancy, and work product privilege.  Hearsay and irrelevancy are not grounds to instruct a witness not to answer; the objection should be noted, and the witness should answer subject to the objection {QC 1}.\n\nStep 3: The claim of work product privilege is a potential basis for instructing the witness not to answer. This is because it could fall under the umbrella of \"enforce a limitation ordered by the court\" if a protective order were in place or being sought {QC 1, QC 2}.  However, it's not automatically permissible simply because the information is claimed to be work product.\n\nStep 4: Option C suggests that the instruction is proper under Rule 30(d)(2), but the relevant rule is Rule 30(c)(2), which governs objections during depositions {QC 1}.  Rule 30(d)(2) is not the relevant provision.\n\nStep 5: The instruction to not answer is only proper if a protective order is sought or in place based on the work product claim, per Rule 30(d)(3)(A) {QC 2}.  The mere assertion of work product privilege is insufficient to justify instructing the witness not to answer.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the instruction is not proper unless a protective order is being sought or is in place. Options A and B are incorrect because hearsay and irrelevancy objections do not justify instructing the witness not to answer. Option C is partially correct in mentioning work product, but implies it's automatically proper, which is incorrect.  Option D accurately reflects that the instruction is not automatically proper.\n\nStep 7: The correct answer is D.  The instruction is not proper unless the defendant is seeking a protective order under Rule 30(d)(3)(A).

            "Context": "A. The meaning of \ufffd\ufffdfailure to state a claim\ufffd\ufffd. It makes sense that a party should not be able to take a case to trial if she seeks relief that a court is not able to grant. Suppose, for example, that Arkwright, owner of a car dealership, sues Miranda for negligence. He claims that Miranda caused an accident on Main Street, that because of the accident traffic was unable to reach his dealership for three hours during his President\ufffds Day sale, and as a result he lost profits. Many states limit recovery in negligence cases to direct personal injury or property damage, and would not recognize a right to recover for secondary economic damages like Arkwright\ufffds. See generally D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, and E. Bublick,  The Law of Torts  (2d ed.) \ufffd611. In these states, a court looking at Arkwright\ufffds complaint could tell that he seeks relief that is not available under the law. Since there is no right to relief, even if Arkwright proves all the facts he has alleged, the court would dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is to test the legal validity of the plaintiff\ufffds allegations, not their factual truth. Consequently, in considering the motion, the court does not ask whether the plaintiff is likely to prove them. The motion does not challenge the plaintiff\ufffds ability to prove her case\ufffdas a summary judgment motion does\ufffdbut only the validity of the legal cause of action she asserts. In ruling on the motion, the court must assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true. The question for the judge is, if they are all true, do they set forth a claim for which the court could grant the plaintiff some kind of remedy. Here\ufffds a question to illustrate the point.",
            "Question": "1. Law and facts.  Snow sues Petrillo for emotional distress he suffered when he witnessed an accident in which Petrillo\ufffds car careened into his parents\ufffd car. The action is brought in federal court in the state of Euphoria, which applies the \ufffd\ufffdimpact rule\ufffd\ufffd to claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Under the impact rule a plaintiff can only recover for emotional distress if she actually suffered a physical impact in the accident caused by the defendant. Mere \ufffd\ufffdbystanders\ufffd\ufffd cannot recover. Snow was not in his parents\ufffd car at the time of the accident. He was waving goodbye to them from the curb, where they had just dropped him off. He claims, however, that Petrillo\ufffds car, when it careened into his parents\ufffd car, threw water on his leg, and that this satisfies the impact rule. Petrillo denies that his car threw water on Snow. He also denies that water splashing is sufficient to satisfy the impact rule under Euphoria law; the impact, Petrillo argues, must be with the defendant\ufffds car itself. He answers the complaint, denying that his car splashed Snow, and then moves to dismiss it for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial judge should",

B.  consider the motion, but deny it if she concludes that water splashing satisfies the impact rule. C.  deny the motion, because Petrillo has denied that his car splashed Snow, raising a question of fact to be litigated. D.  grant the motion, because Petrillo has denied that his car splashed Snow, and Snow cannot recover without proving an impact.",
            "Analysis": "D  is wrong, because it confuses pleading with proof. It is true that Snow cannot recover without proving impact. If in fact Petrillo did not splash Snow, Snow cannot recover, even if splashing suffices as an \ufffd\ufffdimpact\ufffd\ufffd under Euphoria law. However, the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not meant to test whether the facts are true, only whether,  if they are true , they state a right to relief. In passing on the motion, the judge will assume that the facts Snow has alleged are true. So, Petrillo cannot obtain dismissal of the claim by denying that he splashed Snow. The issue posed by the motion is, \ufffd\ufffdassuming that Petrillo did splash Snow, is that sufficient to state a legal wrong for which the court could award damages to Snow?\ufffd\ufffd Whether Petrillo did in fact splash Snow is a question of fact to be litigated later . . . but only if the allegations in the complaint state a legally recognized claim to relief. A  is also wrong, though you need to think back to  Chapter 15  to recall why. The objection that a complaint fails to state a legally sufficient claim may be raised by a \ufffd\ufffdpre-answer\ufffd\ufffd motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). But it also may be made later. The defendant may raise it in the answer, or she may assert it after answering by a motion for \ufffd\ufffdjudgment on the pleadings.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). Petrillo did not waive this fundamental objection to the suit by failing to make a pre- answer motion, or by leaving it out of his answer. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h) (2). C  is also wrong. It states that the motion should be denied because there is a question of fact as to whether Petrillo splashed Snow. True, the parties dispute whether he did, but this would not prevent dismissal for failure to state a claim if that fact is legally irrelevant. If the court assumes (as it will on the motion) that Petrillo  did  splash Snow, but concludes that he is not liable  even if he did , then it should dismiss the complaint. Snow must lose even if he was splashed, if splashing doesn\ufffdt satisfy the impact requirement. Consequently, there\ufffds no need to decide whether he was splashed. On the motion, the court takes the facts alleged in the complaint as true and asks whether, assuming they are true, they would establish a right to relief from the court. If we assume that Petrillo splashed Snow, but splashing doesn\ufffdt satisfy the impact requirement under Euphoria law, Snow doesn\ufffdt state a claim that would entitle him to relief. Even if the court tried the case, and found that Petrillo did splash him, it could not award any relief to Snow. Consequently, there is no reason to litigate the truth of those allegations. So  B  is right. If the court concludes that splashing doesn\ufffdt satisfy the impact rule under Euphoria law, there is no need to prolong the case. The complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. But if the court concludes that water splashing satisfies the impact requirement, the plaintiff will have stated a compensable claim, and the parties will then litigate the contested question of whether the splashing actually occurred.",

            "Context": "Hard cases make new law. Why would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law? Well, it may happen for a number of reasons. First, the plaintiff\ufffds lawyer may not have done her homework, so she doesn\ufffdt realize that a particular claim is legally insufficient. In other cases (unfortunately), lawyers may include legally dubious claims for tactical reasons, even if they doubt that they will ultimately support recovery. And, in another set of cases, it simply may not be clear under applicable law whether the complaint states a legally compensable claim or not. There may not be case law from the state appellate courts that clearly delineates the limits of a legal theory. If that is true, the trial judge faces a difficult task when a plaintiff files a claim and the defendant challenges it as legally insufficient to support relief. Here\ufffds a question that illustrates the trial judge\ufffds dilemma.",
            "Question": "2. Authority on point.  Angeles sues Centerville Hospital, a hospital in the state of Euphoria, for medical malpractice by Dr. Kildare, who operated on her at Centerville. Angeles alleges that Dr. Kildare negligently performed the operation, and that Centerville is liable for Kildare\ufffds negligence, even if Kildare was an independent contractor rather than an employee of Centerville. Her theory is that, to the patient, the surgeon  appears to be  an employee of the hospital, even though surgeons are often actually independent contractors who merely contract for use of hospital facilities. Euphoria courts have never decided whether a hospital is liable for acts of surgeons who use its facilities, under this \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd theory. Courts in a few other states have accepted the argument, however. In her complaint, Angeles alleges that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of Centerville. She further alleges that Centerville is liable for Kildare\ufffds negligence, based on this \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd theory.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The court should dismiss the complaint, because Euphoria has never ruled on the \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd theory. B.  The court should dismiss the complaint if it concludes that Euphoria does not recognize the \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd theory, even though Angeles has pleaded that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of the hospital. C.  The court should not dismiss the complaint, because Angeles\ufffds reasonable belief that Dr. Kildare was an employee is a question of fact, and the motion is only meant to determine the legal sufficiency of the complaint. D.  The court should not dismiss the complaint, because it must take the allegations in the complaint as true on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and Angeles has alleged that Centerville is liable for the acts of Dr. Kildare.",
            "Analysis": "In this case, Angeles has asserted a claim that may or may not be legally valid. The Euphoria appellate courts have never ruled on the question, so the trial judge has no authority to guide her in reaching the legal conclusion as to whether the complaint \ufffd\ufffdstates a claim upon which relief can be granted.\ufffd\ufffd What should she do? A  suggests that the judge should dismiss the complaint, because no Euphoria case has recognized a claim based on the \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd theory before. This appears to be based on the premise that no new theory is a valid theory, or else that a trial court should always reject novel claims, leaving it to the appellate courts to recognize them. This is too narrow a conception of a trial court\ufffds authority. Generally, a trial court must decide whether the claim is valid or not, and it may conclude that it is valid, even if no appellate court has addressed the point. The trial judge might conclude, for example, that appellate cases recognizing the \ufffd\ufffdapparent authority\ufffd\ufffd argument in other contexts indicate that it would be accepted here as well. Or it might rely on the reasoning of courts from other states that have recognized the claim. In the absence of controlling authority from the appellate courts, the question for the trial judge is whether the claim the plaintiff asserts should be recognized, not whether it has been. Trial judges, as well as appellate judges, can pronounce rules of common law, though of course they can also be reversed on appeal if the appellate court disagrees with their holdings. D  is tempting, but wrong. It asserts that the motion should be denied, because the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true in ruling on the motion, and Angeles has alleged that Centerville is liable. Can you see the fallacy in this argument? Surely, the court must take factual allegations in a complaint as true, for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, but it need not assume the truth of legal  allegations. The legal validity of the claim the plaintiff asserts is exactly what the motion is designed to assess. If the court had to accept the plaintiff\ufffds allegation that the cause of action she asserts exists, the motion could never be granted! No, the court will assume the truth of Angeles\ufffds  factual  allegation that she reasonably believed that Kildare was a Centerville employee, but not her  legal  assertion that Centerville is liable for his acts if she did. C  asserts that the complaint should not be dismissed, because there is a dispute of fact as to whether Angeles reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare worked for the hospital. The court cannot decide facts on the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, only the legal sufficiency of the complaint. So doesn\ufffdt the court have to let the case go forward? As in the last question, the parties will only need to litigate the factual issues if they are relevant to a valid claim. Here, whether Angeles thought Kildare worked for the hospital is irrelevant, if that belief would not make the hospital liable. Even if Angeles believed that Kildare worked for the hospital, her claim must be dismissed if, under Euphoria law, the patient\ufffds belief is not enough to make the hospital vicariously liable for Kildare\ufffds negligence. So, if the court holds that apparent authority is insufficient to impose liability on the hospital, it will dismiss Angeles\ufffds claim, regardless of whether Angeles reasonably believed that Kildare worked for it. So  B  is the best answer. If the trial court concludes that Euphoria law doesn\ufffdt impose liability on a hospital for the acts of an independent contractor/ surgeon (even if the patient thought she worked for the hospital), the trial court will dismiss the claim for \ufffd\ufffdfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\ufffd\ufffd In so doing, the trial court is \ufffd\ufffdmaking\ufffd\ufffd Euphoria law. If Angeles thinks the trial judge is wrong in rejecting her claim, she can appeal the dismissal, and get a decision from an appellate court on the apparent authority theory.",

            "Context": "Summary judgment compared: \ufffd\ufffdPiercing the pleadings\ufffd\ufffd. In most cases, the plaintiff\ufffds complaint  does  state a claim for which relief can be granted. It isn\ufffdt usually that hard to allege a valid cause of action. But it is one thing to  allege  the required elements and quite another to prove that they are true. Frequently, the defendant will doubt that the plaintiff can prove all of the elements of her complaint, and wish to challenge her ability to do so before trial. The motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 provides a mechanism for doing so, and for disposing of cases if that challenge demonstrates that the plaintiff has no proof of a required element. 1 Suppose, for example, that Fuentes, the beneficiary on Carello\ufffds life insurance policy, seeks to recover the proceeds of the policy from Reliable Insurance Company. Reliable refuses to pay, arguing that Carello committed suicide; the insurance company would not be liable on the policy if he did. Fuentes sues, alleging that Carello owned the policy, that she was the beneficiary, that Carello died accidentally, and Reliable has breached the contract by failing to pay the proceeds. These allegations state a good claim for breach of contract. If Fuentes proves them, she would be entitled to recover. But suppose that Reliable had good reason to refuse to pay. Reliable investigators had interviewed a witness, Herrera, who will testify that Carello, who was seriously ill, had deliberately jumped from a seventh- story window. Convinced that Fuentes cannot prove an essential element of her claim\ufffdthat Carello died accidentally\ufffdit moves for summary judgment, attaching Herrera\ufffds affidavit swearing that Carello deliberately jumped. Reliable\ufffds motion, supported by admissible evidence (sworn eyewitness testimony) challenges Fuentes\ufffds ability to prove an element of her case. It says to the court, \ufffd\ufffdFuentes may have alleged accidental death, but she can\ufffdt prove that allegation. Our evidence shows that Carello did not die accidentally, so Fuentes cannot recover under the policy. Consequently, there is no dispute of fact about how he died, and we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\ufffd\ufffd This sounds pretty convincing, doesn\ufffdt it? There\ufffds no need to convene a jury and try the case if there\ufffds nothing to try, and Reliable has argued that there really isn\ufffdt anything to try, because there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute\ufffd\ufffd of material fact about how Carello died. If Reliable is right about that, it ought to win, right now, \ufffd\ufffdas a matter of law.\ufffd\ufffd When Reliable makes the motion, challenging Fuentes\ufffds ability to prove an element of her case, and supports the motion with admissible evidence, Fuentes must respond by demonstrating that there  is  a \ufffd\ufffdgenuine issue of material fact,\ufffd\ufffd or the motion will be granted. To defeat the motion, Fuentes must demonstrate that she has admissible evidence\ufffdproof that she could put before a jury\ufffdto support her allegation that the death was accidental. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1), (4). If she has such evidence, the motion will flush it out. If she doesn\ufffdt, the motion has done its job; it has demonstrated that she cannot prove an essential element of her case, and therefore must lose. Consider how the judge should rule in the following example.",

Reliable moves for summary judgment, attaching the affidavit of Herrera, who swears that he saw Carello deliberately jump from the seventh-story window. It also attaches an excerpt from a deposition of Carello\ufffds family physician, in which she states that she had told Carello that he was dangerously ill and not likely to live more than a few more months.

Fuentes hasn\ufffdt done that here. Instead, she has filed an affidavit that simply restates the position in her complaint, that Carello died accidentally. A motion for summary judgment requires more; it requires the party to go beyond stating a position to produce  proof  of that position. There\ufffds a difference between reasserting her opinion that Carello died accidentally, as Fuentes has done here, and supporting it with admissible evidence (Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)) that supports her position. Fuentes has not done that here. A  is right. The motion should be granted, because Fuentes\ufffds reassertion that Carello did not commit suicide is mere opinion, it does not provide any admissible evidence to support that position. If she has such evidence, the motion requires her to produce it. For example, she might submit an affidavit from D\ufffdUrso, another witness to Carrello\ufffds fall, who states that she was there and saw Carello accidentally fall out of the window while trying to adjust a shade. That would pose a direct conflict in the testimony for a jury to resolve. Fuentes\ufffds burden, when the motion is properly supported, is to show that she has admissible evidence to support \ufffd\ufffdher side of the story.\ufffd\ufffd If she has no evidence to support her allegation that Carello died accidentally, she cannot carry her burden of proof at trial, and the judge would grant summary judgment for Reliable. D  is clearly inadequate. In ruling on the motion, the judge does not evaluate the quality of the evidence or the credibility of witnesses. Indeed, she has very little basis to do so based on written affidavits. Her only job is to determine if the evidence is genuinely contradictory, if there is a real dispute on the challenged point. If there is, she denies the motion; if there isn\ufffdt she may grant it. C  also fails, because Fuentes\ufffds affidavit does not establish that there is a genuine dispute  in the evidence  about whether Carello committed suicide. Surely, she and Reliable take different positions on the point, but that isn\ufffdt enough to keep the case going, without some proof from Fuentes that she can back up her position with evidence. And  B  is wrong, because it isn\ufffdt enough for Fuentes to contradict Reliable\ufffds affidavits at the summary judgment stage. When the motion is made and supported with admissible evidence, she must contradict that evidence with countervailing evidence the jury could use to find for her on the cause- of-death issue.

To keep her case alive, she must bring forth opposing evidence that could lead a jury to reject Reliable\ufffds evidence and to find that he died accidentally. A  is wrong, because the judge\ufffds role in ruling on this summary judgment motion is not to determine whether Carello committed suicide. It is only to decide whether Fuentes has produced credible evidence that he did not. If she has produced such evidence, then there is a \ufffd\ufffdgenuine dispute as to any material fact\ufffd\ufffd on the issue, and the jury must resolve it, not the judge. B  is also inaccurate. It isn\ufffdt enough for Fuentes to submit some opposing materials.

It isn\ufffdt at all clear that she has done that here. Even if Carello wasn\ufffdt sure he was mortally ill a week earlier, it is doubtful that, based on this general evidence of his earlier state of mind, a jury could ignore the testimony of Herrera, who was on the spot and testifies that he jumped. But you don\ufffdt have to decide that to reject  B . It suggests that the motion must be denied as long as Fuentes submitted something , and that clearly isn\ufffdt enough to avoid summary judgment. C  fails as well: First, the judge does not decide the truth of Fuentes\ufffds affidavit. How could he? The motion is not a trial, Fuentes is not testifying in person, and the judge does not hear all the evidence. The judge\ufffds role on the motion is simply to decide if the affidavit provides admissible evidence that Carello\ufffds death was accidental, not whether it is true. Second, the affidavit could be true yet not prevent entry of judgment for Reliable. The judge might conclude that, even if it is true that Carello was hopeful the week before, this is not inconsistent with the uncontradicted evidence that he committed suicide a week later. So  D  is the best answer. The judge should deny the motion only if she concludes that Fuentes has demonstrated a genuine dispute of fact for the jury to decide as to whether Carello committed suicide. Her affidavit here is probably insufficient to do that. If I were the judge, and a disinterested witness testified that he saw Carello jump out the window, and the only countervailing evidence was testimony that a week earlier he didn\ufffdt believe he was mortally ill, I would likely grant judgment for the insurer. Testimony that Cavallo had hoped to live and earlier thought that he would does not contradict the testimony that he jumped; it simply provides evidence of his earlier state of mind.

There\ufffds no need to convene a jury and try the case if there\ufffds nothing to try, and Reliable has argued that there really isn\ufffdt anything to try, because there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute\ufffd\ufffd of material fact about how Carello died. If Reliable is right about that, it ought to win, right now, \ufffd\ufffdas a matter of law.\ufffd\ufffd When Reliable makes the motion, challenging Fuentes\ufffds ability to prove an element of her case, and supports the motion with admissible evidence, Fuentes must respond by demonstrating that there  is  a \ufffd\ufffdgenuine issue of material fact,\ufffd\ufffd or the motion will be granted. To defeat the motion, Fuentes must demonstrate that she has admissible evidence\ufffdproof that she could put before a jury\ufffdto support her allegation that the death was accidental. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1), (4). If she has such evidence, the motion will flush it out. If she doesn\ufffdt, the motion has done its job; it has demonstrated that she cannot prove an essential element of her case, and therefore must lose. Consider how the judge should rule in the following example. Under Rule 56(a) summary judgment should be granted only if there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute as to any material fact\ufffd\ufffd and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This is a somewhat misleading provision, unless you parse it very, very closely. Consider this question.",
            "Question": "5. Immaterial materials?  Tang sues Crucible Laboratories, Inc., for injuries suffered in an accident with Jericho, who was driving a Crucible van at the time of the accident. His complaint alleges that Jericho\ufffds negligence caused the accident, that Jericho was acting in the scope of his employment for Crucible at the time, and that Tang suffered a serious back injury as a result of the accident. In its answer, Crucible denies that Jericho was negligent, denies that Tang suffered a back injury from the accident, and denies that Jericho was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. (Crucible would only be liable for Jericho\ufffds negligence if he had been acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident.) Crucible subsequently moves for summary judgment, attaching an affidavit of Gomez, a shift supervisor for Crucible. Gomez states that on the day of the accident, Jericho had received a call that his mother had been rushed to the hospital and borrowed the van to drive to the hospital to visit her. Based on this affidavit, it argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, since the evidence shows that Jericho was not acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Tang responds with two affidavits. One, from his doctor, explains Tang\ufffds serious back symptoms, and expresses the opinion that they were caused by the accident. The other is the affidavit of a witness to the accident, stating that before the accident Jericho had swerved into the opposite lane in front of Tang, causing the accident. Summary judgment for Crucible should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  be granted. B.  be denied, because Tang has submitted evidentiary materials with his opposition to the motion. C.  be denied, because Tang\ufffds supporting evidence shows that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning Jericho\ufffds negligence and the cause of Tang\ufffds back injury. D.  be denied, because the pleadings show that three issues of fact are in dispute: Jericho\ufffds negligence, whether he was in the scope of employment, and the cause of Tang\ufffds back injury.",
            "Analysis": "In a tort case, the plaintiff can only recover if she establishes each element of her claim. If an employer is sued for the tort of an employee, it is only liable if the employee caused the injury in the scope of employment. Tang alleged in his complaint that Jericho did act in the scope, but Crucible\ufffds motion for summary judgment challenges Tang to produce some proof that Jericho did. The Gomez affidavit provides admissible evidence that Jericho acted for his own purposes, not Crucible\ufffds, in driving at the time of the accident. If that is true, Tang must lose. To avoid summary judgment, he must produce admissible evidence that Jericho acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. He didn\ufffdt do that. Summary judgment should be granted for Crucible.  A  is right. D  is the weakest answer. It takes the position that, if an issue is contested in the pleadings, summary judgment can\ufffdt be granted on that issue, because the parties obviously take different positions on it. But summary judgment virtually always is sought on issues contested in the pleadings. The motion says, \ufffd\ufffdall right, Tang, you claim Jericho acted in the scope of employment, but I denied that. And now here\ufffds proof that my denial is true. If you have contrary proof, let\ufffds see it. I\ufffdm challenging you to show that you can not only allege scope of employment, but back it up with admissible evidence.\ufffd\ufffd If Tang can\ufffdt do that, summary judgment may be granted for Crucible, even though Tang alleged that Jericho acted in the scope of employment. C  is the most distracting distractor. What makes it tempting is that puzzling language in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), that summary judgment can only be granted if there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute as to any material fact. . . .\ufffd\ufffd Tang\ufffds affidavits show that he has admissible evidence to show that Jericho was negligent, and that his negligence caused Tang\ufffds back injury. If those issues are disputed, how can summary judgment be granted? Well, in the language of Rule 56(a), these facts are not  material  if Jericho did not act in the scope of employment. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link: If Jericho did not act in the scope of employment, Crucible is not liable for his negligence.  Even if  he was negligent in causing the accident, and  even if  the accident did cause Tang\ufffds sore back, Tang will not recover without establishing the scope-of-employment allegation. So, if Crucible demonstrates that Tang cannot prove any one element of his claim, Crucible is entitled to summary judgment. The rule is confusing on this, but Crucible certainly can get summary judgment without showing that there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute of fact\ufffd\ufffd about  every  issue in the case. B  is clearly wrong. It is not sufficient for the party opposing summary judgment to submit something. She must submit evidence that shows a genuine factual dispute about the element challenged by the motion, here scope of employment. Tang\ufffds materials show that Tang has admissible evidence about two other issues in the case, but do not present anything to contradict Crucible\ufffds evidence that Jericho acted on a personal errand rather than in the scope of employment. Tang needs to produce such countervailing evidence to avoid summary judgment.",

If Reliable\ufffds materials demonstrate that Fuentes cannot establish that point, the court could dismiss the case without ever requiring an answer. At first glance, it seems that  B  is right. Rule 56(c)(1) states that when a summary judgment motion is made and supported as required under Rule 56, the opposing party must produce opposing evidence to show that there is a dispute of fact for the jury to consider. Here, Fuentes has not produced any evidence to contradict Allen\ufffds affidavit.

If Reliable\ufffds materials do not establish that there is no dispute of fact as to whether Carello committed suicide, summary judgment should be denied, even if Fuentes did not submit materials to contradict Reliable\ufffds evidence. So  B  is wrong; Reliable does not win automatically simply on the procedural ground that Fuentes failed to file opposing evidence. A  is also a weak answer.

Here, Reliable\ufffds affidavit doesn\ufffdt show that there is no genuine issue of fact about how Carello died. The evidence in Allen\ufffds affidavit is ambiguous. It would support an inference that Carello intended to commit suicide, but it would also support an inference that he simply intended to use the pills to help him sleep. Consider what would happen if this case went to trial, and Reliable presented Allen\ufffds testimony to prove that Carello committed suicide. That testimony might suffice to support a finding that Carello committed suicide, but it certainly does not compel such a finding, even in the absence of countervailing evidence. Thus, Allen\ufffds evidence, even if uncontradicted, does not show that there is \ufffd\ufffdno genuine dispute of material fact\ufffd\ufffd as to how Carello died.  C  is right; it is not appropriate to grant summary judgment where Reliable\ufffds own materials do not clearly support a finding that Carello committed suicide.

            "Context": "Mixed motions: Rule 12(b)(6) and the \ufffd\ufffdspeaking motion\ufffd\ufffd In deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted, the court only considers the complaint itself, to determine whether, if the allegations in the complaint are proved, the plaintiff would be entitled to some form of relief. Clear though that proposition may be, litigants frequently disregard it \ufffdsometimes consciously, sometimes mistakenly\ufffdin filing Rule 12(b) (6) motions. It is very common for defendants to use the Rule 12(b)(6) motion not to challenge whether the plaintiff has  pleaded  a compensable claim\ufffdthe intended role of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion\ufffdbut rather to challenge her ability to  prove  her case. To do that, they frequently submit evidence with a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to show that she can\ufffdt prove a necessary element of her claim. For example, suppose that Van Dam, a sailor, sues Jimenez, owner of a ship, under a federal statute authorizing recovery from the owner for injuries at sea. In the complaint, he alleges that his injuries took place at sea. Jimenez, however, has evidence that Van Dam\ufffds injury took place on the dock before sailing, which would not be compensable under the statute. So he moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that the complaint \ufffd\ufffdfails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\ufffd\ufffd because the injury took place on land, not at sea. And he attaches to the motion affidavits from witnesses stating that the injury took place before the ship sailed. Although Jimenez\ufffds motion isn\ufffdt strictly proper\ufffdit confuses the role of Rule 12 with that of Rule 56\ufffdmotions like it are filed so often that Rule 12 acknowledges the practice and instructs the court how to deal with such \ufffd\ufffdspeaking motions\ufffd\ufffd (so called because they go beyond a legal challenge to introduce factual evidence outside of the complaint). If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). Under this provision, if the defendant has in effect moved for summary judgment, by submitting  evidence  about the truth of the allegations, rather than challenging their legal sufficiency, the court can convert the motion to a motion for summary judgment and treat it accordingly. The judge will consider the motion not under the Rule 12(b) (6) standard, but the Rule 56 \ufffd\ufffdno-genuine-dispute-of-material-fact\ufffd\ufffd standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and both parties will be given an opportunity to submit admissible evidence relevant to the disputed allegation. The defendant isn\ufffdt really getting away with something by this less than rigorous use of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Rule 56(b) provides that a defending party can move for summary judgment at any time until after the close of discovery, so the court is just treating the motion as the summary judgment motion the defendant could have filed anyway.

The sentence from Rule 12(d) quoted before the question tells the court how to deal with the motion. C  is wrong, because it suggests that the court should treat the motion as one for summary judgment, but then decide it under the Rule 12(b)(6) failure-to-state-a-claim standard. That wouldn\ufffdt make sense. If the judge is going to consider evidence about the scope-of-employment question, she is making a decision not about legal sufficiency, but the presence or absence of evidentiary support for the allegation, and she should use the Rule 56 standard.

It suggests that the judge should deny the motion if she concludes that the complaint is legally sufficient to state a claim. But again, the \ufffd\ufffdspeaking motion\ufffd\ufffd doesn\ufffdt challenge legal sufficiency; it challenges the plaintiff\ufffds ability to prove an allegation in the complaint\ufffd here, that Shea acted in the scope of employment. If the judge treats the motion as one for summary judgment, she should decide it under the summary judgment standard. A  suggests that the judge should treat the motion as one for summary judgment, and grant it if Consolidated\ufffds affidavits show that Shea wasn\ufffdt working at the time of the accident. The problem here is that, if the motion is going to challenge Fenske\ufffds  proof  that Shea acted in the scope of employment, Fenske ought to have a chance to present proof that Shea did  act in the scope, before the court grants summary judgment for Consolidated. When a judge converts a purported Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a motion for summary judgment, she must give the opposing party time to respond to the moving party\ufffds supporting materials, to produce her own admissible evidence to show that the challenged fact is genuinely contested.

            "Context": "The function of the directed verdict motion (judgment as a matter of law before verdict) The purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (motion should be granted where there is \ufffd\ufffdno legally sufficient evidentiary basis\ufffd\ufffd for the jury to find for the party opposing the motion). In a case where the plaintiff\ufffds proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by \ufffd\ufffddirecting a verdict\ufffd\ufffd against her. This older name, \ufffd\ufffddirected verdict,\ufffd\ufffd is suggestive of the motion\ufffds purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally \ufffd\ufffddirect the verdict,\ufffd\ufffd that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn\ufffdt get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff\ufffds verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by \ufffd\ufffdfinding the facts.\ufffd\ufffd However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \ufffd2522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor.  First , she bears the burden to convince the judge  that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the \ufffd\ufffdburden of production.\ufffd\ufffd To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her  second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally  could  find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it  will  find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury\ufffds job is to determine whether she has met the \ufffd\ufffdburden of proof\ufffd\ufffd on each element of her claim, while the judge\ufffds role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant\ufffds motion in the following example. It\ufffds a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant\ufffds breach of the duty of due care caused her damages.",

D  is wrong because, if a plaintiff\ufffds proof is legally insufficient (if she has failed to meet her \ufffd\ufffdburden of production\ufffd\ufffd), the judge has the power to order a judgment as a matter of law for the defendant without letting the jury decide the case. True, she could deny the motion, let the jury deliberate and reach a verdict, and then reconsider whether the evidence is sufficient on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). But she also has the authority, under Rule 50(a), to withdraw the case from the jury before it deliberates, by granting judgment as a matter of law. If she does, the jury never will deliberate on the case. B  is also incorrect. It suggests that the defendant must wait until the close of all the evidence to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\ufffds case. Under the Federal Rules\ufffdand, I\ufffdll wager, under those of most states\ufffdthe defendant may raise that challenge as soon as the plaintiff has had her full chance to present sufficient evidence to get to the jury. When the plaintiff \ufffd\ufffdrests her case,\ufffd\ufffd that is, announces that she has put on all her evidence, she has had her full opportunity to establish a credible case on each element of her claim. At that point, she has presumably presented everything she\ufffds got to establish breach, causation, and damages, 1  so it\ufffds fair to stop the process if, having had that full opportunity, she has failed to produce a submissible case. So the defendant can challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\ufffds case as soon as the plaintiff has fully presented it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (once \ufffd\ufffda party has been fully heard on an issue\ufffd\ufffd the court can consider directing a verdict). The defendant need not wait until the close of all the evidence, though the motion may be made then as well, or may be  renewed  then if it was made earlier and denied. C  is the best answer here. Powers has presented credible evidence that Vicaro treated her, and that her arm has gotten worse. But if that were enough to establish a claim, doctors would be liable every time a patient had a bad outcome. Recovery for malpractice requires something more: proof that the doctor was negligent, that her treatment fell below the standard of reasonable care. Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\ufffds condition, that Vicaro\ufffds treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\ufffds loss of use of the arm. Thus,  A  fails, because the evidence does not suffice to support recovery without a finding that Vicaro was at fault. On the evidence presented, Vicaro may have provided excellent treatment, but still been unable to prevent the loss of use of the arm. Many health problems, alas, remain beyond the power of the medical profession to remedy. Powers bears the burden to produce evidence that Vicaro\ufffds treatment was substandard, that he \ufffd\ufffdbreached the duty of due care,\ufffd\ufffd and that the breach caused his damages. Powers can not recover without submitting credible evidence of  all  the elements of her claim, not just some of them, or a majority, but every element of her cause of action. Here, she put on credible evidence that she suffered damages, evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to find that she has become debilitated. That\ufffds good! But it\ufffds not enough to establish a right to recover, only to prove the damages element of her claim. If the judge allowed Powers\ufffds case to go to the jury on the evidence described, the jury would be licensed to find for her without any proof of a crucial element of her claim. A verdict for her without proof of negligence would be based on legally insufficient evidence. The motion for judgment as a matter of law allows the judge to prevent such legally unsupported verdicts, by refusing to allow the jury to reach them.",

            "Context": "The function of the directed verdict motion (judgment as a matter of law before verdict) The purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (motion should be granted where there is \ufffd\ufffdno legally sufficient evidentiary basis\ufffd\ufffd for the jury to find for the party opposing the motion). In a case where the plaintiff\ufffds proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by \ufffd\ufffddirecting a verdict\ufffd\ufffd against her. This older name, \ufffd\ufffddirected verdict,\ufffd\ufffd is suggestive of the motion\ufffds purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally \ufffd\ufffddirect the verdict,\ufffd\ufffd that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn\ufffdt get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff\ufffds verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by \ufffd\ufffdfinding the facts.\ufffd\ufffd However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \ufffd2522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor.  First , she bears the burden to convince the judge  that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the \ufffd\ufffdburden of production.\ufffd\ufffd To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her  second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally  could  find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it  will  find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury\ufffds job is to determine whether she has met the \ufffd\ufffdburden of proof\ufffd\ufffd on each element of her claim, while the judge\ufffds role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant\ufffds motion in the following example. It\ufffds a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant\ufffds breach of the duty of due care caused her damages. The \ufffd\ufffdburden of production/burden of proof\ufffd\ufffd terminology is a little confusing. Basically, the judge is acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that only cases that could reasonably be decided in the plaintiff\ufffds favor make it to the jury. If this \ufffd\ufffdburden of production\ufffd\ufffd is met, the jury then decides whether the plaintiff wins. The two \ufffd\ufffdburdens\ufffd\ufffd serve different purposes and are addressed to different participants in the trial. Here\ufffds another question that requires you to sort out these burdens.",

A  indicates that the judge should grant the Rule 50(a) motion if she concludes that Powers has failed to meet the burden of proof on any element of her claim. This suggests that the judge should decide whether Powers has proved the elements of her claim, but that\ufffds not the judge\ufffds job in a case tried to a jury. The judge\ufffds job is to decide whether there\ufffds a legitimate dispute in the evidence on each element of the claim, so that there\ufffds a job for the jury to do. To decide that, the judge considers whether Powers had produced enough evidence on each element that a jury, acting rationally on that evidence, could find for Powers. This is the \ufffd\ufffdburden of production,\ufffd\ufffd to submit adequate evidence on each element to raise a legitimate dispute of fact about that element. Certainly, the judge could conclude that the result is debatable (that the burden of production is met) in many cases, even though she believes the defendant has the better part of the debate (that the plaintiff has not met the burden of proof). The judge, as gatekeeper, may only consider whether Powers has met the burden of production. If she has, the jury decides whether she has carried the burden of proof.  A  confuses the burdens. Because the question of meeting the burden of production is a preliminary question for the judge in deciding whether to submit the case to the jury,  C  and  D  are both also wrong. The jury won\ufffdt be told anything about the burden of production, and never considers whether it has been met. Burden of production is a concept used by the judge in determining whether the case is \ufffd\ufffdjury-worthy,\ufffd\ufffd whether the plaintiff has produced enough evidence to get into the debatable range. If the case gets to the jury, they will decide whether the burden of proof has been met, not the burden of production. That leaves  B , which correctly distinguishes the burdens. If the judge, looking at Powers\ufffds case, concludes that she has failed to produce adequate evidence on any element of her claim to support a verdict for her on that element, she should grant judgment as a matter of law (direct a verdict) for the defendant. To get to the jury, Powers must submit enough evidence on each element to meet the \ufffd\ufffdburden of production,\ufffd\ufffd that is, enough evidence that a rational jury could find the element proved.

Should the judge allow the case to go to the jury or not? The first choice,  A , is the most clearly deficient. The judge is definitely not there to decide for herself whom she believes, and take the case from the jury if she is convinced that Sills is telling the truth. Whether Sills was the driver is a classic question of fact, for the jury to resolve if there is a genuine dispute in the evidence.

It\ufffds true that Pavarotti\ufffds evidence is circumstantial (that is, it requires an inference of one fact from proof of others), while Sills\ufffds evidence is direct, through her testimony.

Here\ufffds a question (based on facts shamelessly cribbed from another source) 2  that illustrates the application of these guidelines. One difficulty in applying the judgment-as-a-matter-of-law standard is deciding how to treat the defendant\ufffds evidence. 4  If the plaintiff\ufffds evidence contradicts it, as Pavarotti\ufffds does in the question above, the judge should assume in passing on the motion that the jury will believe the plaintiff\ufffds evidence. But suppose that it doesn\ufffdt directly contradict the plaintiff\ufffds, and is not challenged in any way by the plaintiff. Some courts have said that the judge, in passing on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, should only look at the evidence that supports the plaintiff\ufffds case, and disregard the defendant\ufffds evidence entirely. I\ufffdll call this the \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffds evidence\ufffd\ufffd standard. But other courts have concluded\ufffdand this is the clear majority position\ufffdthat the judge should consider evidence that supports the defendant\ufffds position, if the jury would have no reason to disbelieve it. These courts hold that the judge should consider all the evidence supporting the plaintiff\ufffds case, make all inferences that the jury could make in the plaintiff\ufffds favor, but also consider the uncontradicted, unimpeached evidence for the defendant. See generally Friedenthal, Kane & Miller,  Civil Procedure  555-556 (5th ed. 2015). In the Pavarotti example above, the judge should properly disregard Sills\ufffds testimony in deciding whether to grant her motion for judgment as a matter of law. Pavarotti\ufffds evidence supports an inference that Sills was the driver, and Sills, who testified to the contrary, has a clear motive to lie, so the jury would have a basis for ignoring her testimony. Assuming that the jury doesn\ufffdt believe Sills, and makes the supportable inference from the other evidence that she was the one who hit Pavarotti, it could rationally find that she was. So it should be allowed to decide the case. Now, consider this variant on the Pavarotti case.",

The \ufffd\ufffdplaintiff\ufffds evidence\ufffd\ufffd standard requires her to consider only the evidence that supports Pavarotti\ufffds case. If she does, the answer should be the same here as it was in the last She should deny the motion, because his evidence would support an inference that it was Sills who had hit him, and\ufffdunder the plaintiff\ufffds evidence standard\ufffdthe rather powerful contradictory evidence would be ignored. So  A  is a correct answer. That doesn\ufffdt end the matter, however. We have to consider whether two answers may be correct, given the last two pesky choices. Most multiple-choice questions don\ufffdt include multiple-right-answer choices. This suggests that, when they are included, they may very well be the right answer. Not always, but you should consider the \ufffd\ufffd A  and  C  are both right\ufffd\ufffd choice very carefully when it is offered. So we have to decide how the judge would rule if she uses the other, more common standard, under which she is to consider the evidence for the plaintiff, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, but also any evidence for the defendant that the jury would be required to believe. Would the judge grant the motion (C) or deny it (B)? Here, the jury certainly could discount Sills\ufffds own testimony that it was not her; they could conclude that she is lying to avoid liability. That\ufffds certainly been done before. But how could they ignore the other evidence that she was in Miami at the time? If the newspaper article was a fraud, you would think Pavarotti could have exposed it by getting the real Miami Herald for the day. If she was listed in the program, but didn\ufffdt actually perform that night, plaintiff could have found that out. If the stage manager was lying, or had an incentive to, you would expect that Pavarotti could show through cross-examination what his incentive was. It\ufffds hard to see how a jury could ignore such uncontradicted evidence that Sills wasn\ufffdt the driver. But doesn\ufffdt Pavarotti\ufffds circumstantial evidence about the driver and the car, and the fact that Sills lives nearby and commutes down Maple Street contradict this defendant\ufffds evidence? Not really. Pavarotti\ufffds evidence, alone, would support a rational inference that Sills was the driver. But the basis for that inference is eliminated by her evidence that she was in Miami. Unless the jury has some credible reason to disregard Sill\ufffds evidence, they could not rationally make the inference that it was Sills that hit Pavarotti. Since the article and the stage manager\ufffds testimony are not challenged, it seems very likely that the judge would grant Sills\ufffds motion. Thus,  C  is also a correct statement, but  B  is not. So E  is the best choice.",

            "Context": "Prerequisites for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) In federal court, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury\ufffds verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff\ufffds case is too weak. In Question 1 , for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers\ufffds condition. Now (while it\ufffds unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro\ufffds motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers\ufffds lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\ufffds case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury\ufffds verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury.  Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman , 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case.",

He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. The case goes to trial. At the close of the evidence, Colon moves for a judgment as a matter of law, on the ground that Uberoth has not produced enough evidence to support a verdict that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false. The judge denies the motion, and the jury subsequently returns a verdict finding Colon liable for the misrepresentation. After the jury\ufffds verdict, but before a judgment has been entered on the verdict, Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

            "Options": "Options: A.  deny Colon\ufffds motion, because it was made before the entry of judgment on the jury\ufffds verdict.

C.  deny the motion, since she already determined, by denying the prior motion, that Uberoth\ufffds evidence was sufficient to go to the jury. D.  grant the motion if she concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that Uberoth relied on Colon\ufffds statements in making the investment.",
            "Analysis": "Let\ufffds start by eliminating  C . It suggests that the judge, by denying the earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law, has determined that Uberoth\ufffds evidence is sufficient, so this issue is settled. The fact that the judge denies a motion for a directed verdict does not always mean that she has concluded that the plaintiff\ufffds case is adequately supported by the evidence. It may simply mean that she is reserving judgment, perhaps hoping that the jury will settle the issue by finding for the defendant. The very point of Rule 50(b) is that the denial of a prior motion under Rule 50(a) does not inevitably mean that the judge considers the evidence sufficient. It may simply reflect her desire to \ufffd\ufffdsave the trial\ufffd\ufffd by ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence after the verdict rather than before. The right answer here flows from the rationale for the Rule 50(b) requirement that the motion for judgment be made before the case goes to the jury, in order to preserve the right to seek judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a verdict. Here, Colon moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, on the ground that the evidence did not show that he knew that the statements he made about the investment were false. This motion put Uberoth on notice of a possible weakness in his proof of this element of his case. If he had further evidence about Colon\ufffds knowledge that the statements were false, he could ask the court to allow him to reopen his case, and submit that proof. But the motion on this ground did  not  put Uberoth on notice that his proof of reliance, a separate element, was inadequate. When Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground, the challenge comes out of the blue, at a time when Uberoth can no longer do anything about it. In the language of poker, Colon has \ufffd\ufffdsandbagged\ufffd\ufffd Uberoth by keeping this objection in his back pocket, letting the case go to the jury and raising the reliance issue after the jury\ufffds verdict, when it is too late to offer any further evidence of reliance. Of course, it\ufffds true that it\ufffds Uberoth\ufffds case to prove. He should know the elements of a claim for fraud, and assumes the responsibility of proving them at trial. If he hasn\ufffdt proven one of them, perhaps he should take the consequences. But the point of the Rule 50(b) requirement of a prior Rule 50(a) motion is to put him on notice of the defect before the case goes to the jury, and Colon didn\ufffdt put him on notice of the defect in proof of reliance at that point. It is not enough that he moved for judgment as a matter of law on  some  ground to preserve his right to judgment as a matter of law after the verdict. His motion must raise the objection he renews in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. So  B  is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon\ufffds failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth\ufffds proof before the case went to the jury. Although  D  seems like it should be right, Colon will have forfeited his right to judgment on this ground by failing to raise it before the case goes to the jury. This is one more illustration of a basic point: procedure matters. A  is a little tricky. Rule 50(b) provides that the motion may be made \ufffd\ufffdwithin twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment.\ufffd\ufffd But there\ufffds no reason it can\ufffdt be made  before  entry of judgment. As soon as the jury returns a verdict for Uberoth, Colon will be in a position to raise the objection. He could make the motion right then, in open court. The twenty-eight-days-after-judgment rule is an outer limit on when it can be made; it doesn\ufffdt mean that it couldn\ufffdt be made sooner. See, e.g., Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. v.

            "Context": "\ufffd\ufffdDirecting the verdict\ufffd\ufffd in a judge- tried case The function of the motion for judgment as a matter of law is to allow the judge to control the jury, in cases where it is not clear that they have a meaningful role to play. But in many cases there is no jury; the judge not only administers the trial, but also hears the evidence and finds the facts. Judges act as the fact finder where neither party requests a jury, and in many cases in which the parties do not have a right to jury trial. How do motions for judgment as a matter of law work in a judge- tried case, where the judge is finding the facts? How does she apply the concepts covered in this chapter, particularly the burden of production and the burden of proof? The short answer is that Federal Rules 50(a) and (b) don\ufffdt apply at all in a judge-tried case. See the heading of the rule, \ufffd\ufffdJudgment as a Matter of Law in a Jury Trial.\ufffd\ufffd And there\ufffds a good reason for this. These motions exist to prevent the jury from deciding for a party on the basis of insufficient evidence. The judge doesn\ufffdt have to constrain  herself  from doing that, where she is the fact finder. If the judge thinks the plaintiff\ufffds evidence is too weak to support a verdict for her, she can simply rule that the plaintiff hasn\ufffdt proved her case! And, because she is the fact finder, she is not required to assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and assume that the jury will believe her witnesses. She does that in a jury case because she has to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, to preserve the jury\ufffds role. But there\ufffds no jury role to preserve in a judge-tried case. So, the judge can decide what she believes about the facts and rule for the defendant if she concludes that the plaintiff\ufffds proof on any required element is inadequate. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) (once a party has been fully heard on an issue, the judge may enter judgment against the party if the court finds against her on the issue).

What standard should Judge Fortera use in evaluating the evidence at this point? A  indicates that Judge Fortera should ask herself whether Uberoth has produced enough evidence to support a rational verdict for him. But why should the judge use that standard? She isn\ufffdt deciding whether the case is worthy of jury consideration. It\ufffds a judge trial; she is deciding the facts. She doesn\ufffdt have to ask whether a jury could be convinced by Uberoth\ufffds evidence. She has to ask whether she, as the fact finder,  is convinced by it. When Colon moved for judgment in his favor, Uberoth had had his full opportunity to prove that Colon knew his statements were false\ufffdto meet his burden of proof on the point. So  A  is wrong. Judge Fortera should not ask whether Uberoth has produced rational evidence on the issue of Colon\ufffds knowledge, but whether he has carried his burden of proof on it. Uberoth has had his shot at it, presented what he has. If it doesn\ufffdt convince Judge Fortera, the fact finder, the case need go no further. She can enter judgment against Uberoth on the issue. D  isn\ufffdt right either: The judge need not wait until Colon presents his case. There\ufffds no need to hear Colon\ufffds rebuttal evidence if the plaintiff has had a full shot at proving the knowledge-of-falsity issue, and her own evidence hasn\ufffdt established it by the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.  C  also fails. Uberoth must establish that Colon knew the statements were false in order to recover, and hasn\ufffdt.

        {
            "Context": "New trial motions based on legal errors at trial Assume that a case has been tried, it has gone to the jury, and the jury has returned a verdict. Why would a judge, instead of entering judgment for the verdict winner, grant a new trial? If she does, the first jury\ufffds verdict is disregarded. All their work, and that of the court and the parties in trying the case the first time, goes for naught. The trial process starts over, with the selection of a new jury, opening statements, and so forth. This seems like a waste. There are a number of reasons why a court might choose to nullify the jury\ufffds verdict and start over. One common reason is for an error of law in the conduct of the first trial. Suppose, for example, that Brown sues Little for injuries suffered in an accident. At trial, the judge admits important evidence offered by Brown to establish Little\ufffds negligence, over Little\ufffds objection, and the jury finds for Brown. Little moves for a new trial, arguing that the judge wrongly admitted the evidence. If the judge concludes that the evidence was inadmissible under the rules of evidence, she could, and probably would, grant a new trial. Little has a right to have the case tried properly under the established trial rules. If the judge is convinced that she made a mistake of law in admitting the evidence, Little has not had a trial by the proper rules, so it seems fair to start over and do it by the book. Consider what will happen in Little\ufffds case if the judge  doesn\ufffdt  grant a new trial. Little will likely appeal, arguing that the trial was unfair due to the admission of the improper evidence. If the appellate court agrees, it will order the case remanded for a new trial, at which the improper evidence will not be admitted. So, if the judge doesn\ufffdt correct the error herself, by granting a new trial, the parties will likely end up going through the expense and delay of an appeal, probably giving rise to a published opinion reversing Her Honor\ufffds decision. No trial judge enjoys being reversed. So, for several reasons, if the judge is convinced that she committed reversible error at the first trial, she would be well advised to order a new one herself. If the evidence wasn\ufffdt admissible, why did the judge admit it? Well, things happen fast at trial, and many decisions have to be made on the spot. A decision may seem right at the time but on quieter reflection and further research prove ill-advised. So Little might convince the judge, after the fact, that she made a mistake of law, and that the wisest course would be to try the case again. In the federal courts, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 authorizes the trial judge to order a new trial for errors of law. State courts have similar new trial rules as well. Of course, Little should not keep objections like this in her back pocket and spring them on the judge after the jury reaches a verdict. She should object to any ruling that might prejudice her case when the judge makes it. That way the judge, if convinced, can change her mind and prevent reversible error. Consequently, the court will not ordinarily grant a new trial for trial mistakes unless an objection was made at the time the judge made the mistaken ruling. The trial judge makes many legal rulings at trial that might form the basis for a new trial motion. Another example is improper jury instructions. The judge has to instruct the jury, before they deliberate, on the legal rules that govern the plaintiff\ufffds claim\ufffdthe rules of negligence in a tort case, or the elements of a contract claim in a contract case, and so on. If she gives a mistaken instruction, the jury will apply the wrong legal rules in reaching their verdict. Suppose, for example, that she instructs the jury that \ufffd\ufffdthe plaintiff cannot recover if she is more negligent than  any  defendant,\ufffd\ufffd and the jury concludes that Brown, the plaintiff, was 20 percent at fault, the first defendant, Little, was 10 percent at fault, and Berle, the other defendant, was 70 percent at fault. Under the judge\ufffds instruction, the jury would be bound to return a verdict for the defendants, since Brown was more negligent than one defendant. If the proper instruction should be that \ufffd\ufffdthe plaintiff may not recover if she was more negligent than the defendants\ufffd\ufffd (i.e., the defendants as a group), the judge\ufffds error has led the jury to return the wrong verdict. If the judge reads the statute and the cases and concludes that her instruction was wrong, she should bite the bullet and start the process over again. And the same is true for other mistakes of law during the trial. Here\ufffds a tricky question to get us started. Reading Rule 59 will be useful in answering it.",

Defendant\ufffds counsel didn\ufffdt do anything about it at the time. In retrospect, she casts around for some ground to undo an unfavorable result. She uncovers the judge\ufffds mistake of law in admitting the evidence and moves for a new trial on that ground. D  is refuted by Rule 59 itself, which provides that a motion for a new trial \ufffd\ufffdmust be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment.\ufffd\ufffd Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(b). Even though judgment has been entered, the rule gives litigants a short window after entry of judgment to seek a new trial. (They may also seek it after the verdict but before judgment is entered on the verdict as well.) B  makes an interesting point. Who is to say that the jury found for Hazak based on this improper evidence? They may have based their verdict on the other, proper evidence instead, so that Hazak would have won whether or not the improper evidence was admitted. If the motion for a new trial is granted, and the case is retried without this evidence, Hazak may well win again. That\ufffds true. We don\ufffdt know for sure that the improper evidence led to the verdict. But we don\ufffdt know for sure that it  didn\ufffdt  either. Where the error may have affected the outcome, the appropriate remedy is generally to grant the motion for a new trial, since the verdict might have been different if the mistake of law had not been made. Only if the judge is convinced that the error was \ufffd\ufffdharmless,\ufffd\ufffd that is, that the erroneous admission of evidence of other assaults clearly did not affect the result, should she refuse to grant the motion for a new trial. But there is another problem here. In this case, Keller\ufffds counsel did not object to the improper evidence when it was offered at trial. Had she done so, the court would presumably have recognized the problem and excluded the evidence, avoiding the error and saving the trial. It is counsel\ufffds job to assist the court in avoiding error by raising objections when a judge\ufffds ruling may prejudice her client\ufffds rights. If she doesn\ufffdt do so, she will usually be precluded from relying on the judge\ufffds error as grounds for a new trial or on appeal. Thus,  C  is the best answer. Consider the possibilities for manipulation if courts allowed counsel to seek new trials based on trial mistakes they had not pointed out during the trial. Counsel might deliberately withhold her objection to one or more of the judge\ufffds rulings at trial. Then, if she loses the verdict, she could pull these out and argue for a new trial. This would give counsel an incentive for manipulation that the system ought not to countenance. Hence, the court will not ordinarily grant a new trial on a ground not brought to its attention at the time the error was made. See generally Wright & Miller \ufffd2805. (The exception sometimes suggested is that a judge has the power to grant the motion if the error, though not raised by the losing party\ufffds counsel, \ufffd\ufffdwas so fundamental that gross injustice would result.\ufffd\ufffd Id.) Why is  A  not correct here? If the judge refuses to grant the new trial, won\ufffdt Keller take an appeal based on the admission of the improper evidence? And won\ufffdt the appellate court reverse based on the error? Again, not if Keller\ufffds counsel failed to object at the time of its admission. The appellate court, like the trial court, usually will not allow Keller to \ufffd\ufffdsandbag\ufffd\ufffd Hazak by appealing on the basis of an error that she did not bring to the judge\ufffds attention when it was made. Keller has waived the objection by failing to raise it at the time of the trial judge\ufffds ruling.",

            "Context": "New trial motions based on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence It seems fairly obvious that a litigant should get a new trial if the judge made an error of law. You have a right to have the process done right, and if it wasn\ufffdt, to have it done again. Granting a new trial where the jury\ufffds verdict is against the weight of the evidence is more perplexing. The case is tried; the jury deliberates and reaches a verdict. Now the loser moves for a new trial, arguing not that the judge made a mistake of law at the trial, but that the jury made a mistake in rendering a verdict for the other side. This just seems like sour grapes. Sour grapes it may be on the losing party\ufffds part, but the judge does have the authority, in the federal system and many state systems as well, to order the case retried if she is convinced that the verdict is seriously suspect. The idea is that the judge should have the authority, in egregious cases, to protect against improper jury behavior based on sympathy for a plaintiff or other improper grounds. Which cases are egregious enough for the judge to invoke this considerable power? Rule 59 doesn\ufffdt expressly tell us, but a variety of verbal formulas are used in the cases. Some hold that the judge may order a new trial if the jury\ufffds verdict is \ufffd\ufffdagainst the great weight of the evidence,\ufffd\ufffd represents \ufffd\ufffda miscarriage of justice,\ufffd\ufffd  or the jury has reached a result which is \ufffd\ufffdseriously erroneous.\ufffd\ufffd And, in making the assessment whether the verdict is \ufffd\ufffdthis wrong,\ufffd\ufffd the judge may consider the credibility of the evidence. She is not asking\ufffdas she does on a directed verdict motion\ufffdwhether the jury  could  find for the plaintiff if they believe the evidence. Rather, she is asking whether the jury was clearly, seriously wrong in choosing to believe it. Although this standard intrudes more on the jury\ufffds role as fact finder, it is usually justified on the ground that granting the motion sends the case to a new jury rather than leading to entry of a judgment for the party who lost before the first one. Consider, in answering the following question, how this standard relates to the standard for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.",
            "Question": "2. Judging the jury.  Angelos sues Faithful Investment Co. for fraudulently misrepresenting the value of an investment that Faithful had solicited from Angelos. He claims that their investment brochure contained deliberate fraudulent statements about the investment. At trial, Angelos\ufffds expert testifies that the brochure contained several errors which seriously inflated the value of the investment and understated the risk. Faithful\ufffds employees testify that these were simply good faith mistakes, and that they had no intent to defraud Angelos. The jury returns a special verdict finding that Faithful had not intentionally misled Angelos. Angelos moves for a new trial, on the ground that the jury\ufffds verdict is not supported by the evidence.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  The trial judge must deny the motion unless she concludes that no reasonable jury could have found as the jury did. B.  The trial judge must deny the motion unless, taking all the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to Faithful, the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. C.  The trial judge may grant the motion if she is firmly convinced that Faithful\ufffds witnesses are not credible, so that a verdict for Faithful is against the clear weight of the evidence. D.  The trial judge may grant the motion if she believes that Angelos had established fraud by a preponderance of the evidence.",
            "Analysis": "This question compares the standard for granting a new trial with the standard for directing a verdict. Recall that when the judge directs a verdict, she takes the case away from the jury and decides it herself, because, as a matter of law, the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for the nonmoving party. The standard for doing that should be rigorous, and it is. The judge should not direct a verdict unless the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable jury could find for the other party. But granting a new trial is less drastic, since it doesn\ufffdt deprive the parties of a jury decision, but rather submits the case to another jury. So, the standard for doing so is a bit looser as well. If  D  were true, the standard would be too loose. It asserts that the judge should order a new trial if she believes that the losing party should have prevailed. This would allow the judge to grant new trials whenever she disagreed with the verdict. That standard would give the trial judge too much discretion to disregard the jury\ufffds finding, simply on the ground that the judge disagreed with it. A  sets too stringent a standard. It equates the power to grant a new trial based on the weight of the evidence with the standard for directing a verdict. It would only allow the judge to grant a new trial in cases in which no reasonable jury could find for the plaintiff. There would be little point to the separate new trial option if it were only available in those cases. B  is close. It states the great-weight-of-the-evidence standard, which is a commonly stated standard for new trials based on the strength of the evidence. But it suggests that the judge, in applying that standard, must take all inferences in favor of Faithful, the party that won the verdict. That is required when deciding whether to direct a verdict, but not when deciding whether to grant a new trial. In deciding whether to grant a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the judge may make judgments about whether an inference is appropriate from the evidence, and may discount evidence she finds clearly unworthy of belief. For example, suppose that Angelos had testified at the trial that Faithful\ufffds sale rep had provided inaccurate explanations about the meaning of the brochure. And suppose that this testimony, if believed, would support a verdict for Angelos on the fraud claim\ufffdbut the judge is strongly convinced that Angelos is lying. In passing on the motion for a new trial (unlike a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50), the judge does not have to assume that Angelos\ufffds testimony will be accepted by the jury. If she (the judge) is firmly convinced that it is false, and therefore the jury\ufffds verdict is wrong, she can order a new trial. Admittedly, this does indeed substitute her judgment for that of the jury, in a sense, but again, the result is a new jury trial, not a judgment for Faithful. So  C takes the prize. If the judge is firmly convinced that the witnesses Faithful relies upon are not credible, she may grant a new trial.",

            "Context": "New trials based on newly discovered evidence Suppose that Baker and Whitney are involved in an accident, and Baker sues Whitney for his injuries. The parties are the only witnesses at trial, and each testifies that the other ran the red light. The jury finds for Baker, awarding a large verdict. Before the judgment is entered, the award is reported in the paper, and a week later Motz contacts Whitney\ufffds lawyer. He tells her that he was looking out the window of a nearby building and saw  Baker  run the light, but had not come down to the scene or notified the police that he had witnessed the collision. Whitney\ufffds lawyer moves for a new trial, arguing that she has \ufffd\ufffdnewly discovered evidence\ufffd\ufffd that should be considered in determining whether Whitney is liable for the injuries. There is certainly an argument for allowing a new trial here. The jury\ufffds verdict was based on the testimony of the parties, who both have an interest in skewing the facts in their favor. Here\ufffds an impartial witness whose testimony might be very persuasive. Shouldn\ufffdt we give Whitney another chance? How could we  not  do so? The primary argument for refusing new trials based on the discovery of new evidence is that the system is burdened enough trying to process cases once, without retrying them every time a party comes up with something they didn\ufffdt present before. In addition, if counsel know that a new trial will probably not be an option, they will have a significant incentive to find all the relevant evidence the first time. Last, if courts routinely granted new trials on this basis, lawyers might be tempted to game the system, by withholding some marginal evidence, and then\ufffdif they lose at trial\ufffdasserting it as the ground for a motion for a new trial. So, there are policy considerations on both sides. Typically, the rules and cases take a middle ground. They give the trial judge discretion to grant new trials based on newly discovered evidence, but with limits. First , most courts will deny the motion if the evidence should have been discovered earlier if the moving party\ufffds counsel had been diligent in preparing for trial. And,  second , they will scrutinize the new evidence to determine whether it could significantly impact the jury\ufffds evaluation of the case. If the new evidence is marginal, or purely cumulative of other evidence the jury heard, the motion is likely to be denied. In Whitney\ufffds case, the motion would likely be granted. Motz\ufffds evidence is very significant\ufffdthe only evidence available from a disinterested witness. And nothing suggests that Whitney\ufffds counsel should have found out about Motz before trial.

            "Question": "3. The ungrateful guest.  Knox, a recreational pilot, crashes his plane on takeoff one January morning in Maine. Sardinha, his passenger, sues him for damages in federal court. Sardinha\ufffds theory is that the wings of the plane had iced up, causing the flaps to freeze and preventing Knox from controlling the plane. The case is tried to a jury. Six witnesses at the field that morning, including three flight mechanics on duty at the time of the flight, testify about the weather conditions at the field that morning and the condition of the plane. Experts for both parties testify about whether it was negligent to attempt the flight given the weather conditions at the time. The jury returns a verdict finding that Knox, the defendant, was not negligent. After the verdict, but before judgment is entered upon it, Sardinha moves for a new trial. He supports his motion with an affidavit stating that he has located a Federal Aviation Administration manual setting standards for bad weather flights, which he argues Knox failed to follow. He also states that he has located a witness, Lindbergh, who checked out icing conditions on the field shortly before Knox\ufffds takeoff, and decided not to fly himself. Lindbergh had not previously come forward, and no one had identified him as a potential witness before the first trial. The judge will probably",

            "Analysis": "This question is more a matter of judgment than most. But some professors gravitate to such questions, because they want to evaluate students\ufffd ability to exercise judgment in close situations. A trial judge\ufffds decision on a new trial motion requires just such an exercise of discretion. (Of course, the judge would have more information on which to base the decision than most multiple-choice questions can provide.) The problem with granting the motion based on the FAA manual is that Sardinha\ufffds counsel almost certainly should have found it in preparing for trial. Surely, his expert would be familiar with relevant FAA materials. They are very likely public documents commonly available, and the witnesses\ufffdboth Sardinha\ufffds and Knox\ufffds\ufffdwould likely be aware that FAA standards exist. It will be extremely hard for Sardinha\ufffds counsel to explain why this is new evidence that could not have been discovered with due diligence prior to the first trial.

However, Lindbergh\ufffds evidence seems both marginal and cumulative. Numerous witnesses who were on the spot testified as to the weather conditions at the time of the flight. Lindbergh\ufffds testimony doesn\ufffdt seem likely to add much about the conditions that the jury hasn\ufffdt already heard. Given the interest in repose, and the waste of resources involved in retrying decided cases, new evidence should be pretty compelling to merit starting over.

            "Context": "New trials based on excessive or inadequate damages A judge may also grant a new trial if the damages awarded are grossly excessive or inadequate. If the evidence supports an award of $40,000, and the jury awards $500,000, that verdict is \ufffd\ufffdagainst the great weight of the evidence\ufffd\ufffd or \ufffd\ufffda serious miscarriage of justice.\ufffd\ufffd Thus, new trials on this basis are simply a specific application of the principle that a judge may order a new trial where the original verdict is seriously erroneous. However, where a new trial is sought on this ground, it may not be necessary to retry the entire case. The judge might conclude that the jury\ufffds finding that the defendant is liable for the claim is proper, but that they awarded too much in damages . . . or too little. In that case, she may order a partial new trial, limited to the proper amount of damages. (New trials may similarly be limited to discrete liability issues, such as an affirmative defense or one element of a claim.) The judge may also use the device of remittitur if she concludes that liability was properly determined but the damages awarded are so high as to \ufffd\ufffdshock the conscience\ufffd\ufffd of the court. Remittitur offers the plaintiff a kind of settlement. The judge says to the plaintiff, \ufffd\ufffdAll right, I\ufffdm willing to accept the jury\ufffds finding that the defendant is liable to you, but the $800,000 in damages that they awarded is clearly unsupported by the evidence. I could grant a new trial. In fact, I  will  grant a new trial . . . unless you are willing to accept $200,000. If you\ufffdll accept that, I\ufffdll enter judgment on the jury\ufffds verdict for that amount. If you won\ufffdt, we\ufffdll start over and do it again.\ufffd\ufffd The judge\ufffds offer of a remittitur (usually prompted by a defendant\ufffds motion for it) puts the plaintiff in a tough spot. Two hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money. If the damages are uncertain, as where intangible injuries like pain and suffering and emotional distress are being valued, another jury might give $75,000. It takes steady nerves to \ufffd\ufffdroll the bones\ufffd\ufffd by refusing the remittitur and taking your chances on a new trial. I\ufffdll wager that, for this reason, plaintiffs accept remittiturs a good deal more often than they refuse. If the judge offers a remittitur, and the plaintiff acquiesces, judgment will enter for the plaintiff for the remitted amount. The plaintiff may still be very unhappy, having had $600,000 lopped off of the jury\ufffds award. However, in the federal courts, the plaintiff cannot accept the remittitur and then appeal the trial judge\ufffds decision to make her choose between taking a remitted award and facing a new trial. The plaintiff is viewed as having made a deal that bars her from appealing the judgment she accepted.  Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co. , 429 U.S. 648 (1977). If she wants to appeal, she must refuse the remittitur, go through the new trial, and (if she gets a smaller award in the new trial, or loses entirely),  then appeal the judge\ufffds decision to grant the new trial after the first jury\ufffds verdict. This is an unenviable position for the plaintiff, to say the least. Very probably, she has waited long enough to get to trial the first time and needs funds to deal with the consequences of her injury, rather than to go back into the queue for another trial. Suppose the jury finds for the plaintiff, but awards a damage amount that the judge finds unconscionably low? In some states, the judge may grant an \ufffd\ufffdadditur,\ufffd\ufffd that is, offer the  defendant  the choice between facing a new trial and agreeing to an increased award. Why would the defendant agree to pay  more  than the jury awarded? Presumably, the incentive is to avoid the expense of a new trial and the risk of an even larger award from a second jury. However, federal courts cannot use the additur device. In a dubious decision,  Dimick v. Schiedt , 293 U.S. 474 (1935), the Supreme Court concluded that it would be unconstitutional for a federal court to give an additur, since it would grant the plaintiff damages that the jury had not awarded. This question explores the judge\ufffds options where the jury renders an arguably improper damage verdict.",

            "Analysis": "This question simply requires an understanding of the judge\ufffds options where the jury\ufffds liability finding is supported by the evidence, but the damages are well below the reasonable range.

Although the judge can\ufffdt use additur, she doesn\ufffdt have to enter judgment on the verdict if it would be a miscarriage of justice to do so.  D isn\ufffdt right, because we know that the judge still has the authority to order a new trial where the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result, whether the error is in the amount of damages or in finding liability at all. Dimick  did not bar new trials based on improper damage awards, only additurs based on them. So the judge has the option to order a retrial if she is convinced that the size of the jury\ufffds verdict is outside the range of permissible results. The only question, then, is whether she should order a full retrial, or a partial retrial of damages only. Since the question indicates that the judge considers the liability verdict sound, there is no reason to retry the liability issues. The judge should order a retrial of damages only.  B  is the best answer.",

            "Context": "New trials based on improper influence on the jury Another ground for granting a new trial is that the jury, or some of them, were subject to some improper influence that may have affected their deliberations. This could happen in a number of ways. A juror might talk to counsel for one of the parties, or to a party, or to a witness, either in the courthouse or on the street. A trial is a ritualized process, tightly protected from outside influences. The court and counsel orchestrate the production of the evidence the jury is to consider, and test that evidence through presentation and cross-examination. If a juror gets additional evidence from some other source, this untested information may affect the jury, without being subject to scrutiny through the rules of evidence or cross-examination. In re Beverley Hills Supper Club Litigation , 695 F.2d 207 (6th Cir. 1982), provides a dramatic example. In the  Beverly Hills Supper Club case, a fire in a night club caused many deaths. A major issue was whether aluminum wiring in the walls had started the fire. The plaintiffs argued that such wiring overheats at the connection to receptacles, creating a risk of fire. After a twenty-two day trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, rejecting this theory. Later a juror wrote to a local newspaper, explaining that the fire couldn\ufffdt have happened that way: He had that wiring in his house, and had gone home, taken the plates off the outlets, and found none of the conditions that the plaintiffs argued had caused the fire. Based on this juror experiment, the court ordered a new trial, since the juror had not only conducted the experiment, but had communicated his findings to other jurors. While this seems counterintuitive, barring real world information from the jury, it makes good sense. This evidence may have been very persuasive to the jury, yet improperly so. Who is to say that the juror\ufffds receptacles were the same as those in the night club, or that they were installed in the same way, under the same conditions or using the same wire? Had this evidence been introduced at trial, the plaintiffs\ufffd counsel could have challenged it on such grounds, but if it goes directly to the jury instead, it is not subject to correction or explanation. If a judge finds that extraneous information has found its way into the jury room, she will not automatically grant a new trial motion. Very likely, she will hold a hearing to ascertain how the jury considered the information, whether the evidence was too peripheral to affect the outcome, was simply repetitive of information already before them from the trial, or did not prejudice the party who lost the verdict (where, for example, the extraneous information actually supports the losing party\ufffds case). Only if she is convinced that there is a significant possibility that the improper evidence has affected the jury\ufffds decision will she bite the bullet and order a new trial. Of course, jurors bring a great deal of knowledge and experience with them into the jury room. Jurors do rely on their experience, and this is one of the strengths of the jury system. But there is a distinction\ufffd sometimes a fine one\ufffdbetween testing the evidence against one\ufffds general experience, and introducing evidence into the jury\ufffds deliberations that was not placed before the jury by the parties. Here\ufffds a question that explores that distinction.",
            "Question": "5. The voice of experience.  Ewald sues Stein for injuries suffered when Stein\ufffds sixteen- foot truck rolled down a hill into his car. Ewald alleges, and submits evidence at trial to show that Stein was negligent, because he left the truck parked on a hill, with the emergency brake on, but did not turn the wheels toward the curb. His theory is that the brake was insufficient to hold the truck, so that Stein should have pointed the wheels toward the curb, to prevent it from rolling down the hill into his car. Stein argues that he acted reasonably in relying on the emergency brake. After the parties have presented their proof, the jury is instructed on the basic standard of negligence, and proceeds to its deliberations. During the deliberations, Stepner, one of the jurors, states that he had rented trucks about the size of Stein\ufffds a number of times, and that he always had trouble with the emergency brake on those trucks because the size of the truck requires a very strong brake to hold it. In fact, one time he had a brake let go, causing the truck to roll. The jury renders a verdict for Ewald. A week later, before judgment has entered, Stein\ufffds lawyer runs into one of the other jurors on the street, and the juror mentions Stepner\ufffds comments. Stein\ufffds lawyer files a motion for a new trial, based on the jury\ufffds consideration of extraneous information. The judge should",
            "Options": "Options: A.  grant the motion for a new trial. B.  conduct a hearing to determine whether the jury\ufffds decision was influenced by Stepner\ufffds information. C.  grant a new trial if she believes the information may have influenced the other jurors in reaching a verdict. D.  deny the new trial motion.",
            "Analysis": "If Stepner\ufffds comments were an improper extraneous influence on the jury,  B  would be the appropriate answer. But it seems doubtful that they were improper. Surely, jurors can contribute information about a case from their general experience. If they couldn\ufffdt, how could they decide? They are meant to bring their understanding of the world to bear on the issues they are deciding. If a driver is alleged to be negligent for driving at the speed limit on a rainy day, the jurors have to consider, based on their life experience, whether that was a reasonable thing to do. This is not to say that they should ignore the evidence, but that they are there to  evaluate  the evidence, and they use their judgment and experience to do so. Isn\ufffdt that what Stepner has done here? He\ufffds used his own experience with similar vehicles in similar circumstances to evaluate the reasonableness of Stein\ufffds conduct. If this were considered to \ufffd\ufffdinfect\ufffd\ufffd the jury\ufffds deliberations with outside information, a jury\ufffds verdict would seldom be safe from impeachment.  D  is the best answer. Stepner\ufffds consideration of his own experience, and sharing that experience with the other jurors, is a permissible part of the jury\ufffds deliberations, and would not support the grant of a new trial.  C  is wrong, because Stepner\ufffds comments were permissible, and therefore would not taint the verdict even if they did influence the jury.  A  is also wrong, because there was no inappropriate outside influence that has tainted the verdict, only appropriate consideration of the evidence in light of experience. It would be different if Stepner went out and rented a similar truck and conducted experiments parking it on various hills. That would surely be an improper experiment that would lead to a new trial. But using his general knowledge of trucks to help form a judgment about the reasonableness of Stein\ufffds conduct is Stepner\ufffds job as a juror, not his fault.",

And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\ufffds verdict as \ufffd\ufffdagainst the great weight of the evidence,\ufffd\ufffd a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\ufffds instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would  you  do?

But if she won\ufffdt do that, you\ufffdd certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions.

So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge\ufffds rulings on these motions?

Orwell then moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that the jury\ufffds verdict was against the great weight of the evidence.

Parkins may appeal the grant of judgment as a matter of law, but not the decision to grant the new trial, since the new trial has not yet taken place.",
            "Analysis": "The crux of the matter here is that the judge has granted the defendant\ufffds motion for judgment as a matter of law. She has concluded that the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for Parkins. Consequently, Orwell is the winner. Judgment should enter for him. But Rule 50(c)(1) tells the trial judge not to leave it at that, to rule \ufffd\ufffdconditionally\ufffd\ufffd on the motion for a new trial too. When the judge does that, she is saying, \ufffd\ufffdI\ufffdve taken the verdict away from Parkins and ordered judgment entered for Orwell, because the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for Parkins. So I\ufffdm granting judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) for Orwell. Rule 50(c)(1) tells me I have to rule on the new trial motion too, so I\ufffdm stating that, if the appellate court reverses my Rule 50(b) ruling, I would grant a new trial in this case, because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\ufffd\ufffd Fine, but where does the case go from there?  C  is wrong, because Rule 50(c)(2) provides that a conditional grant of a new trial \ufffd\ufffddoes not affect the judgment\ufffds finality.\ufffd\ufffd The judge has ordered final judgment entered for the defendant, and that will happen. The case is over in the trial court. If no appeal is taken, the judgment for Orwell will stand as the final adjudication of the case. True, the judge has said that, if her order is overturned, there should be a new trial, but only if the order is overturned on appeal. So there is a final judgment, and the case is therefore appealable. But which order is appealable, the order for judgment as a matter of law, or the new trial order, or both?  D  is wrong, because both orders are appealable. That\ufffds the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case. Even though the ruling on the new trial is \ufffd\ufffdconditional,\ufffd\ufffd that is, it will only take effect if the grant of judgment as a matter of law is reversed, that ruling is still reviewable. If the appellate court reverses the entry of judgment for Orwell under Rule 50(b), it can then decide whether the motion for new trial was appropriately granted. Thus,  B  fails as well. Both orders are appealable. If the appellate court concludes (after reversing the judgment for Orwell) that the new trial was properly granted, it will remand for the new trial. If the court concludes that this motion also should not have been granted, it will reverse the new trial order too, and order entry of judgment for Parkins on the jury\ufffds verdict.

            "Analysis": "This one should not have given trouble. Here, the appellate court has concluded that the evidence was strong enough to support a verdict for Sardinha, so that entry of judgment for Knox as a matter of law was wrong.

Judgment should not enter for Knox either, as  B suggests. After all, Sardinha won at the trial, though it was not a proper trial leading to a valid verdict. The proper ruling is to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial with the proper causation instruction. Choose  C .

            "Context": "The importance of joinder to claim preclusion analysis The premise underlying claim preclusion is that, once a party has litigated a claim, she should be barred from doing so a second time. Respect for the first court\ufffds authority, the parties\ufffd reliance on settled rights, and the need to conserve judicial resources all support a refusal of the second court\ufffdeither the same court that originally decided the case or another court\ufffdto relitigate it. However, fairness suggests that a party should only be precluded from litigating a claim in a second action if she litigated it in the first action, or was  entitled  to litigate it there. Claim preclusion would deprive a party of due process of law if it barred a court from considering a claim in a second action that the party could not have presented in the first. Thus, in determining what claims are barred by claim preclusion in a second action, it is important to know what claims could have been\ufffdor could not have been\ufffdasserted in the first. Today, most procedural systems allow much broader joinder of claims than courts did a hundred years ago. In the federal courts, and in many state court systems as well, a plaintiff may join any claims she has against a defendant, even if they are based on different theories or seek different types of relief. Under earlier procedural rules, plaintiffs were much more constricted in joining claims. They might, for example, under the common law \ufffd\ufffdforms of action,\ufffd\ufffd have been barred from joining claims based on different types of legal theories, such as tort and contract. They might also have had to seek different types of relief, such as money damages or equitable relief (an injunction, rescission of a contract, or an accounting, for example) from different courts. Here\ufffds a simple example to illustrate the relationship between the scope of joinder under civil procedure rules and the operation of claim preclusion.",
            "Question": "1. Ruin and res judicata.  Mulligan hires DeLay to restore his 1933 Rolls Royce, but claims that DeLay ruined it rather than restored it. He sues DeLay in the state courts of Emporia. The State of Emporia does not jump at fancy new concepts, like the unified civil action recognized in Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It remains content with the old common law forms of action. Under Emporia procedure, a plaintiff who brings suit under a writ of assumpsit may assert any contract claims she has against the defendant, even for breach of two unrelated contracts. However, she could not assert claims based on a tort theory under a writ of assumpsit, even if the tort claim arose out of the same underlying facts as the contract claim. Mulligan brings an action in assumpsit against DeLay, seeking damages for breach of contract for the work on the Rolls. Mulligan\ufffds action is dismissed on a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that his contract is unenforceable under the Emporia statute of frauds. A final judgment enters for DeLay. Shortly thereafter, Mulligan brings a new action against DeLay, based on the writ of trespass on the case, alleging that his negligent work on the Rolls rendered it worthless. Under Emporia procedure, an action on the case allows assertion of claims based on negligence. Mulligan\ufffds second action will probably",

C.  be barred, because it is based on the same transaction as the first. D.  be barred, because he should have joined it in his first action.",
            "Analysis": "The fundamental point here is that Mulligan was unable to assert his negligence claim in his initial action based on the writ of assumpsit. The joinder rules of Emporia, which limit claims under a writ of assumpsit to contract claims, simply didn\ufffdt allow it. So the question is, having sued on the assumpsit claim and lost, can he now bring a second action on the negligence claim? It would certainly be tough on a litigant in Mulligan\ufffds position if he could not. He would have to choose between his two possible theories of relief, bring one or the other, and lose the one he did not pursue in the first action. I suppose one could make a rational argument for such a system of claim preclusion, but it would certainly force plaintiffs to make some tough tactical decisions. No system your author knows of operates that way. Instead, claim preclusion rules generally bar a party from bringing claims that he either did join in the first action or  could have  joined in that action. Once a judgment is rendered on a claim, it is final \ufffd\ufffdnot only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\ufffd\ufffd  Cromwell v. County of Sac , 94 U.S. 351, 352-353 (1876). However, if the first court was unable to entertain a claim, for lack of jurisdiction or lack of authority under the joinder rules, a second action on the omitted claim will not be barred. Here,  D  is wrong because Mulligan could not join his negligence claim in the first action. Under Emporia procedure, the writ of assumpsit limited him to asserting contract-based claims. And  C  is wrong because, as just stated, where a claim could not have been joined in the first action, a second action on that claim will generally not be barred, even if it arose (as this one did) from the same transaction as that asserted in the first action.  A  is not quite wrong, but it isn\ufffdt the best answer. It implies that a claim is not barred, as long as it was not asserted in a prior action. But frequently, claims will be barred that were not asserted in the first suit. The key question is not whether the claim was asserted, but rather whether it  could have been  asserted in the prior suit. If it could have been joined, but was left out, it usually will be barred. But here the claim could not have been asserted in the first suit, because of the very limited Emporia joinder rules. So  B  is right. Where a party leaves out a claim because it could not be included, claim preclusion will not bar a second action on that claim. Under modern procedure, this will rarely happen. Most American procedural systems allow very broad joinder of claims arising from a single dispute. Since the right to join such claims is broad, the bar on later actions based on that dispute is equally broad.",

But how about the converse situation, where a plaintiff could have joined a claim, but doesn\ufffdt? Will all such omitted claims be barred from assertion in a later action, or, if not, which will and which will not? Today, the federal courts, and many state courts, apply the \ufffd\ufffdtransactional\ufffd\ufffd approach to claim preclusion set forth in the Second Restatement of Judgments. Under the Second Restatement approach, parties who have litigated a transaction are barred from litigating any further claims that arise from the same set of underlying facts. For example, if they had an accident, and litigated whether the defendant was liable for it, the judgment in that action would bar any further lawsuit between them arising out of that accident. Or if they entered into a contract for repair of the plaintiff\ufffds computer system and, after the work was done, litigated the adequacy of the defendant\ufffds performance of the contract, the judgment in that action would bar any further action seeking relief arising out of that transaction. The premise of this approach is that, if the parties are going to litigate a set of historical facts\ufffdthe accident, the repair transaction, whatever\ufffd they should resolve all their disputes arising from that set of events together in the first action, rather than nickel-and-diming each other (and the courts) by successive law suits involving the same dispute. This \ufffd\ufffdtransactional\ufffd\ufffd approach is permissible today because most courts apply broad rules of joinder that authorize a plaintiff to assert all claims she has arising out of the same underlying facts in a single suit. Because the joinder rules authorize the plaintiff to seek all the relief she may be entitled to in the first action, the doctrine of claim preclusion or res judicata may fairly force her to do so. Thus, under the Second Restatement, a party is held to waive any claims she leaves out of the first action, if they arise from the transaction that was litigated in that action. The language used in claim preclusion analysis can be confusing. Most courts hold that a plaintiff who has previously sued the defendant will be barred from suing her again on the \ufffd\ufffdsame claim.\ufffd\ufffd But this does not mean that, if Mulligan sues DeLay on a contract claim arising from his work on the Rolls, he can sue DeLay again on a tort \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd arising from that work. The term \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd in this context means the underlying transaction or set of facts that gave rise to the dispute, not a particular legal theory. The present trend is to see claim in factual terms and to make it coterminous with the transaction regardless of the number of substantive theories, or variant forms of relief flowing from those theories, that may be available to the plaintiff; regardless of the number of primary rights that may have been invaded; and regardless of the variations in the evidence needed to support the theories or rights. The transaction is the basis of the litigative unit or entity which may not be split. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \ufffd24, cmt. a. Under Second Restatement analysis, if Mulligan sued DeLay for the Rolls job on a contract theory, he would be barred from suing him a second time for that work on a tort theory. Both suits would be for the same \ufffd\ufffdclaim,\ufffd\ufffd because both would seek relief based on the same underlying set of facts. Thus, while Mulligan might have tort and contract \ufffd\ufffdclaims\ufffd\ufffd (in the sense of legal theories for relief) arising from DeLay\ufffds restoration work, he only has one \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd arising out of it for purposes of claim preclusion analysis. This chapter focuses on the Second Restatement approach, which continues to gain adherents. But there are other approaches to claim preclusion. These approaches tend to cling to older conceptions that prevailed when the forms of action and law/ equity distinctions loomed larger than they do today. For example, some courts hold that a plaintiff who has sued the defendant may assert a new claim based on a different \ufffd\ufffdprimary right\ufffd\ufffd arising out of the underlying events. This approach focuses on the legal theory of recovery in the two actions, allowing a second action on a different theory or for invasion of a distinct interest. For example, under this approach, some courts have allowed a plaintiff who sued a defendant for property damage arising out of a motor vehicle accident to bring a second action for personal injuries arising from the accident, on the ground that the two claims involve invasion of different rights. See, e.g.,  Carter v. Hinkle , 52 S.E.2d 135 (Va. 1949).

He seeks damages for breach of a contract to build an addition on his house. He claims that Miller breached the contract by using substandard construction materials. The jury renders a verdict for Miller, and judgment is entered on the verdict. Subsequently, Aronson sues Miller again, in Arcadia, this time for negligence. He claims that Miller\ufffds employees were negligent in interpreting the contract specifications, and consequently built the addition one hundred square feet smaller than the plans required.",
            "Options": "Options: A.  Aronson\ufffds second suit will be barred, because the first action determined that the house was built correctly. B.

            "Analysis": "A  is a bit muddled. It suggests that the first action resolved the issue Aronson seeks to litigate here, the size of the house, so that collateral estoppel will bar relitigation of that issue. But the size issue was never litigated in the first action, only the quality of the materials. B  is also a loser, since it suggests that Aronson\ufffds too-small argument will only be barred if it was litigated in the first action. Under the Second Restatement\ufffds transactional approach, claims that arise from a single transaction are barred if they were raised or  could have been  raised. This one clearly could have been asserted in the first action, since Arcadia (like federal courts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) allows broad joinder of claims.

            "Analysis": "If you keep the basic Second Restatement test in mind, this example shouldn\ufffdt be heavy lifting. The crucial point is that, under the Second Restatement, a plaintiff who brings a claim against a defendant for a particular set of events must assert all claims she has against the defendant that arise from that set of events. Any such claims that could have been brought, but were not, will be barred by claim preclusion. Here, the Town sued Montrose for the transfer station paving job. Arcadia\ufffds broad joinder rules would have allowed it to join any other claims it had arising from that job. The claim for damage to the shrubbery  does  arise from the same events as the Town\ufffds first action, the paving work at the transfer station. Consequently, under the \ufffd\ufffdsame claim\ufffd\ufffd approach of the Second Restatement, it will be barred from asserting that claim in a second action. The basic idea is simple: If you are going to sue Montrose for the paving job, you must seek all the relief you might be entitled to arising from that job in the first action. If you don\ufffdt, res judicata will bar you from seeking it in a second. While the shrubbery claim is based on a different theory, and involves collateral damage from the paving, it does arise from the transfer station paving work, so it had to be asserted in the first suit. Since it was not, it is barred by res judicata. Thus,  A  is wrong. However, the school paving job is a different transaction from the transfer station job. Consequently,  D  is wrong. The Town was not required to assert its claim for the school job when it sued Montrose for the transfer station job. Although the school-paving claim had already accrued, and under Arcadia procedural rules it  could have been  asserted in the first action, the claim preclusion principles of the Second Restatement do not force the plaintiff to join all claims she has against a defendant in her first suit. It only provides that any further claims that arise from the transaction that was the basis of the first action are barred. Since the school paving claim arises from a different set of events, the Town did not have to assert it in the first action, and is not barred from suing on it separately. B  implies that the Town\ufffds contract claim based on the school paving job would be barred. This appears to be based on the logic that the Town sued before on a contract theory, so it should have joined all contract claims it had against Montrose in the first action. But this isn\ufffdt right. Since the second contract claim arises from a different transaction from the first, the Town was not required to join it and will not be barred from suing on it separately. The key to preclusion is not that the second action is based on the same  legal theory ; it\ufffds that it arises from the same underlying facts  that were litigated in the first. Thus, the right answer is  C . The negligence claim will be barred, since it arises from the same transaction as the first suit.

            "Question": "4. Pipe dreams.  Carzis Company, an Arcadia construction contractor, orders two thousand feet of PVC pipe it plans to use in a sewer construction project from Hassan Supply. Hassan fails to deliver the pipe on time, so Carzis buys the pipe from another supplier, and finishes the job, though with a serious delay. A year later, Carzis sues Hassan in the courts of Arcadia to recover a $7,000 deposit it had paid Hassan toward the cost of the pipe, and recovers a judgment for that amount. At the time of Carzis\ufffds action, consequential damages (that is, secondary damages such as the delay Carzis suffered here) for breach of contract were not available under Arcadia contract law. However, a year later the Arcadia Supreme Court held that, where the seller is specifically notified of the intended use and that time is of the essence, consequential damages may be recovered. After the Arcadia Supreme Court\ufffds decision, Carzis sues Hassan again, in the Arcadia court. It claims consequential damages for the delay it suffered in completing the sewer project.

Last, relying on the same statements by Hassan\ufffds salesperson, he includes a claim under the Federal Interstate Deliveries Act (FIDA), which authorizes damages for fraudulent misrepresentation in interstate sales.

            "Analysis": "A  can\ufffdt be right. Certainly the state Consumer Protection Act claim should be barred. It arises out of the same transaction\ufffdthe agreement to supply pipe to Carzis for the sewer construction project\ufffdas the initial action. No reason appears why it could not have been asserted in the first suit. Thus, it should have been. Remember, the key to preclusion under the Second Restatement approach is whether the claim arises out of the transaction that was litigated in the first action,  not whether the particular theory was asserted or litigated in that action. While Carzis never asserted a claim under the Consumer Protection Act, it could have, and since this claim arose from the same pipe supply contract as the initial suit for a refund, it should have been joined. The penalty for failing to do so is that it is barred by res judicata. The same is true for the claim arising under federal law. This claim also arises out of the negotiations for the pipe contract for the project. Thus, under the Second Restatement\ufffds transactional test, it is part of the same claim that was litigated in the first action. The fact that the claim arises under federal law rather than state law does not change this result. The question indicates that FIDA claims (like most claims that arise under federal law) may be asserted in state court. Since the federal claim arose from the same events as the refund claim, and could have been brought in the first action, Carzis is barred from suing on it later. That knocks out  B . The tough issue here is posed by  C , and admittedly, I didn\ufffdt lay out the governing black letter rule before the question. But the principle of repose that underlies res judicata should suggest the result. Here, Carzis sued on his contract claim, and obtained a judgment. Case closed. Normally, res judicata would attach to that final judgment, and bar Carzis from seeking any further relief based on the pipe transaction. But here Carzis will argue, \ufffd\ufffdwhen I sued the first time, the law did not allow consequential damages. Now that the Arcadia Supreme Court has changed the law to allow such damages, I want \ufffdem! Since the claim could not have been asserted in the original action, I should be allowed to assert it now.\ufffd\ufffd It isn\ufffdt hard to see that Carzis\ufffds argument would unsettle many settled cases. If parties could bring a new action whenever the law changed, cases would be only provisionally over; they might still be resurrected if the legal rules changed. In most situations, Carzis\ufffds argument will be rejected. Parties have the right to one decision on their cases, under the law as it exists at the time of decision, not to multiple decisions under the law of 1999, the law of 2009, and again under the law of 2021! In addition, note that Carzis  could  have asserted his claim for consequential damages in his original action. He would have lost on it in the trial court, of course, since at the time Arcadia appellate case law did not recognize a right to consequential damages. The trial judge in Carzis\ufffds case would have been bound by those decisions. But Carzis could have taken an appeal, and the Arcadia Supreme Court, which changed the rule a year later, might well have changed it in his case instead. Better to leave Carzis to this remedy, than to revisit old judgments every time the legal rules change in the future. So, the best answer is  D . All of Carzis\ufffds claims in his second action arise out of the same sale that he sued upon before, and are barred by claim judicata and res preclusion, or whatever you call it.",

            "Context": "The type of judgment that triggers claim preclusion It is commonly said that res judicata only applies if the judgment in the prior action was rendered on the merits of the case. This requirement is deceiving, however, since a party is frequently precluded from relitigating even though she never litigated anything \ufffd\ufffdon the merits\ufffd\ufffd in the prior action. The point of the \ufffd\ufffdon the merits\ufffd\ufffd requirement is to prevent courts from giving claim preclusive effect to certain procedural dismissals of the first action. For example, if Reynoso sues in federal court, and her case is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no court would bar her from suing on the same claim in state court. She never had a full opportunity to have her case heard in the first action. Indeed, the court\ufffds reason for dismissal was that it could not hear the claim. As we saw at the outset of the chapter, where a legal theory can\ufffdt be asserted in the first action, a second action on that theory will not be barred. So dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and similarly, for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, are not viewed as \ufffd\ufffdon the merits,\ufffd\ufffd and do not preclude a second action in another court competent to entertain the claim. In other situations, however, dismissals that clearly do not involve litigation of the claim itself do bar a second action, even though we would not think of them as decisions \ufffd\ufffdon the merits.\ufffd\ufffd (For this reason, the Second Restatement shies away from the phrase entirely.) If a defendant fails to respond to the suit, for example, and judgment is entered by default for the plaintiff, there has clearly been no litigation on the merits. Yet most courts give res judicata effect to a default judgment. That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the  opportunity  to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing. On the same rationale, a plaintiff who files an action and does not pursue it, leading to a \ufffd\ufffddismissal for failure to prosecute,\ufffd\ufffd will be barred from bringing a second action. If litigation was commenced, and there was no procedural impediment to prevent the court from hearing it, the parties have had their opportunity to litigate and should either grasp it or recognize that they have waived it. In some cases, the parties may reach the merits but not go to trial. For example, a claim may be resolved on summary judgment, when the court finds that there is no dispute of material fact and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Or, a case may be dismissed at the outset for \ufffd\ufffdfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\ufffd\ufffd In both of these situations, the court has concluded that the plaintiff cannot recover, though neither involves a trial. Virtually all courts would give claim preclusive effect to a summary judgment, and a good many treat the dismissal of a case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (or similar state court rules) for failure to state a claim as a bar to a new action. When a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff will be given the opportunity to replead, to try to state a compensable claim for relief. She may also seek to dismiss the action \ufffd\ufffdwithout prejudice,\ufffd\ufffd that is, with express recognition by the court that the dismissal of the first action will not bar another suit on the same claim. If the plaintiff takes neither of these avenues to avoid the demise of her claim, it is probably because she cannot state one. Consider whether the second claim would be barred in the following example.",
            "Question": "5. Procedure and substance.  Akbar sues Rajiv Motors in an Emporia court for injuries suffered while driving a used snowmobile that Rajiv had sold to him. His suit is based on breach of warranty (a contract theory) and strict products liability, a tort theory. Rajiv moves to dismiss the contracts claim, on the ground that the Emporia long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over it. The judge concludes that the long-arm statute allows suit against Rajiv for tort claims, but not contract claims, and dismisses the breach of warranty claim. The case goes to trial on the strict liability claim. After Akbar presents his evidence, the trial judge grants a directed verdict for Rajiv, on the ground that Akbar has not presented sufficient evidence that the snowmobile was defective. Judgment is entered for Rajiv. Later, Akbar sues Rajiv again, for the same injuries, again in the Emporia courts. He bases his claim in this action on a negligence theory. Assuming that the principles of the Second Restatement of Judgments apply, Akbar\ufffds second action",

B.  will not be barred, because the contract claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, so there has been no final decision \ufffd\ufffdon the merits.\ufffd\ufffd C.  will not be barred, because the grant of the directed verdict motion did not decide the case on the merits in the first action. D.  will not be barred, since his claim in the second action is not the same claim as his claim in the first.",
            "Analysis": "This case is something of a hybrid, since part of it was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction, while the rest of it was litigated to a final judgment in favor of the defendant. But basic principles should point you to the answer. If Akbar had brought a second action (perhaps in another court) on the contract claim, it would not have been barred, since the first court determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction to entertain that claim. As we said at the outset, a party is almost never precluded from bringing a claim that it  could not  have litigated in an earlier action. But here Akbar did not sue a second time on the claim that was dismissed for procedural reasons. He brought a new claim on a new tort theory.  D  is wrong here, because the negligence claim is \ufffd\ufffdthe same claim\ufffd\ufffd as the strict products liability claim: They both arise out of the same accident. And, since the court in the prior action concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear tort claims arising from that accident under the long-arm statute, it presumably had jurisdiction to hear the negligence claim as well as the strict liability claim. Thus, the negligence claim was based on the \ufffd\ufffdsame claim\ufffd\ufffd as Akbar\ufffds first suit, could have been heard in the first case, and was left out. Under Second Restatement claim preclusion principles, it will be barred . . . if the first case was decided on the merits. It was decided on the merits.  C  is wrong, because the parties here went to trial on the strict liability claim. Akbar had his full opportunity to present his evidence, and the judge determined that it was insufficient to support a reasonable verdict in his favor. Like the grant of a motion for summary judgment, the grant of a directed verdict motion resolves the case on substantive grounds: The judge has determined that the plaintiff\ufffds proof is not strong enough to prevail, and orders a judgment for the defendant. Thus, claim preclusion will apply to bar the negligence claim here.  A  is right.",

            "Context": "The \ufffd\ufffdsame parties\ufffd\ufffd requirement for claim preclusion Although a judgment in a suit against a defendant bars the plaintiff from asserting any further claims against that defendant arising from the same events, it does not bar claims against other actors the plaintiff  might have sued for the same injuries. \ufffd\ufffdThe basic premise of preclusion is that parties to a prior action are bound and nonparties are not bound.\ufffd\ufffd Wright & Miller \ufffd4449. Thus, in the common terminology of claim preclusion, preclusion requires that the parties to the second action be the \ufffd\ufffdsame parties\ufffd\ufffd as the parties to the first. The simplest example of this involves a plaintiff who sues one defendant for injuries arising from an accident, loses, and then sues another. Generally, this is permissible. Jones, by suing Smith, does not lose the right to sue Doe at another time in another court . . . or at the same time in another court, for that matter. His claims against different defendants are viewed, for claim preclusion purposes, as distinct, so that the assertion of his \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd against Smith does not affect his right to assert his separate \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd against Doe in another action. Similarly, if Jones and Gomez, two passengers in Smith\ufffds car, are injured due to his negligence, each has a separate claim against Smith. If Jones sues for her injuries, and the case goes to judgment, it will not affect Gomez\ufffds right to sue separately for his. The litigation world would be a lot more complicated if res judicata theory did not include this \ufffd\ufffdsame parties\ufffd\ufffd limitation on the effect of a judgment. If suing one defendant gave rise to a res judicata bar on Jones\ufffds claims against all possible defendants, he would be forced to sue them together in a single action, or lose his claims against the omitted defendants. Jones may not wish to do that, or even be able to do that, due to limits on joinder, personal jurisdiction, or subject matter jurisdiction in the court he prefers. Thus, the \ufffd\ufffdsame parties\ufffd\ufffd limit appropriately reconciles res judicata theory with the rules on joinder and jurisdiction. Even if a person was a party to a prior action, preclusion may not apply if she was not a direct adversary of another party in the case. Suppose, for example, that Puckett sues Caribe and Ostend, two defendants, in an action arising out of a business deal. He claims that Caribe breached her contract to deliver 50,000 widgets he needed for his business, and that Ostend, the agent who arranged the transaction, misrepresented Caribe\ufffds ability to deliver. Although Caribe and Ostend are codefendants, they are not adversaries. Neither has asserted a claim for relief against the other, and, in fact, they may both be raising the same defenses to Puckett\ufffds claim. Suppose that Puckett loses, because the jury concludes that Caribe had complied with her obligations under the contract. If Ostend had a claim against Caribe for his commission, he would be free to sue Caribe for it in a separate action. Even though he and Caribe were both parties to the prior action, they were not adversaries. Ostend could have asserted a cross-claim for his commission (at least, under Federal Rules practice\ufffdsee Rule 13(g))\ufffdbut chose not to. Because his \ufffd\ufffdclaim\ufffd\ufffd for the commission is not the same as Puckett\ufffds claim against him and Caribe, he could still bring a separate action for his commission against Caribe. There are a few situations in which a nonparty will be bound by a judgment. These usually arise where one of the litigants in the prior action expressly represented the interests of the nonparty. Suppose, for example, that the trustee of a trust sues a bank, claiming that the bank mismanaged the assets of the trust, leading to a loss of value. If the trustee lost, a beneficiary of the trust could not then sue on the same theory. The trustee was empowered to represent the interests of the beneficiaries, and sued on their behalf. Because he litigated on behalf of the beneficiaries, they would be bound. Similarly, legatees of a will would be bound by litigation on their behalf by an executor. On a similar rationale, a buyer of property would be bound by a judgment against the seller. Suppose, for example, that Estrada sued to keep a neighbor from walking across her property to the beach, and the court determined that the neighbor had an easement to do so. A purchaser from Estrada would be bound by that determination of Estrada\ufffds interest in the property, on the theory that Estrada could only convey the interest she actually held. In cases like these, it is held that the represented party is \ufffd\ufffdin privity\ufffd\ufffd with the party who sued and therefore bound by the result in the prior litigation. But such situations are rare. In most contexts, one party is not bound by the results in another party\ufffds suit, even if she has a similar interest in establishing liability of a defendant. With this warm-up, have a try at the following question.",
            "Question": "6. Through the roof.  Granite State Crane Company was working on a job installing air conditioning equipment on the roof of a warehouse owned by Regal Property Management. Its crane operator landed a large mechanical ventilator on the roof a bit too hard, causing cracks in the seams of the roof. Three rainy days later, water leaks through the cracks, ruining electronic products stored in the warehouse by Conductrol Products, Inc. Regal sues Granite State in federal court for the cost of repair to its roof, and recovers. Although it could have joined as a coplaintiff (see Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)), Conductrol did not. Subsequently, Conductrol sues Granite State, again in federal court, for damages to its products stored in the warehouse. Conductrol\ufffds action will be",
            "Options": "Options: A.  barred, because Conductrol shared the same interest as Regal in proving negligence of Granite State. B.  barred, because Conductrol, the lessee, was in privity with Regal, the lessor of the warehouse space. C.  barred, because Conductrol could have joined as a coplaintiff in Owner\ufffds action. D.  not barred, because Conductrol\ufffds claim is different from Regal\ufffds for res judicata purposes.",
            "Analysis": "In this example, the defendant\ufffds negligence causes an invasion of the interests of both the owner and a lessee who stored goods in the warehouse. One sues and recovers for his damages. What effect does that have on the other\ufffds right to sue? The general rule is that each party has her own claim, and may choose, within the limits of the joinder rules and principles of jurisdiction, to sue when and where she wants. In a few narrow circumstances, however, where one party\ufffds interests are clearly asserted by another, the represented party may be barred from relitigation. A  suggests that Conductrol will be barred from bringing its own action, because it has the same interest in proving Granite State\ufffds negligence that Regal does. It does share an interest in establishing Granite State\ufffds negligence, but that isn\ufffdt enough to make Regal its representative and bar Conductrol from suing separately. Imagine that it were, and Regal sued first and lost. That would bar actions by anyone who had goods stored in the warehouse, just because the owner had sued and failed to recover. Unlike the situation of a trustee or executor, no one has expressly designated Regal to represent Conductrol\ufffds interests, nor could it sue for Conductrol\ufffds losses. It can only sue for its own. True, when it sues for its own damages, Regal will try to establish Granite State\ufffds negligence, just as Conductrol will when it sues for its losses. But there\ufffds a world of difference between having a mutual interest in establishing a defendant\ufffds negligence and one party representing another\ufffds interests in a way that will bar the other from bringing its own claim.  A  is wrong; although Regal and Conductrol both have an incentive to establish Granite State\ufffds liability, Regal did not represent Conductrol\ufffds interests or sue for its losses. Conductrol may bring its own action to collect those losses. B  is wrong for the same reason; Conductrol is not \ufffd\ufffdin privity\ufffd\ufffd with Regal just because it rents space from Regal. By renting space from Regal, Conductrol does not delegate authority to Regal to represent its interests in a suit against third parties. Indeed, their interests may be adverse to Regal\ufffds in some respects: Conductrol might want to sue Regal on the theory that it caused the damage due to negligent maintenance or should have discovered the leak and limited the damage. Thus, there is hardly the unity of interest between the two that makes it fair to conclude that Regal represented Conductrol\ufffds interests in the first action. C  also fails. It suggests that, if a party could join in another\ufffds action against the defendant, she must do so or lose her claim. Under the basic elements of claim preclusion, that isn\ufffdt so. Each party has her own \ufffd\ufffdclaim,\ufffd\ufffd and is entitled to sue on it separately. Had Conductrol joined in Regal\ufffds action, it would be barred from suing again. But, having decided not to, it is free to sue separately. This is consistent with the Federal Rules\ufffd approach to party joinder, which allows, but does not require parties with claims arising out of the same transaction to sue together. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(1) (parties \ufffd\ufffdmay\ufffd\ufffd join as plaintiffs if they seek relief arising out of the same transaction or occurrence). So  D  takes the prize. Conductrol is not barred from bringing its own action for its damages, since it is not the same party as Regal for claim preclusion purposes. In some cases, a lessee might be bound by litigation by the lessor. Suppose that the owner of property sued to prevent trespass by a neighbor, and it was held that the neighbor had an easement to cross the property. If the owner then leased the property to Jones, Jones would be bound by that prior litigation. The owner can only convey to Jones the interest he holds in the property. If it has been determined that his interest is subject to the easement, Jones takes the owner\ufffds interest subject to that limitation. See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments \ufffd43 and accompanying commentary. But the situation here is clearly different.",

            "Context": "The \ufffd\ufffdsame issue\ufffd\ufffd requirement. If an issue was litigated between the parties in an action, and comes up again in a later suit, there\ufffds little point in litigating it again. But, obviously, estoppel should only apply if the issue in the second action really is the same  as the one resolved in the prior action. The court can hardly take an issue as decided if it wasn\ufffdt. Suppose that Higgins agrees to buy a small business from DeVito. After the sale contract is signed, but before closing the deal, he sues to rescind the transaction, claiming that DeVito had misrepresented the annual income of the business. The court finds that DeVito had not misrepresented the income, and refuses to order rescission. After the sale, when Higgins fails to make an installment payment due on the sale, DeVito sues to collect. Higgins now defends again on the ground that the sale is void, because DeVito misrepresented the income of the business. In this example, there is no reason to relitigate the misrepresentation issue. It is the same issue the parties litigated before. The judge heard the evidence and decided the issue in the prior suit. And that decision was necessary to reach the judgment in the prior suit: The reason the judge denied rescission was that she concluded that there had been no misrepresentation, so that the transaction was valid. It would be unfair to DeVito to make him muster the evidence on the point again, and take the risk of losing before a new finder of fact. And it would be a waste of the court\ufffds time to retry the misrepresentation issue in the second action.

In Suit Two, Collins claims that Mora \ufffd\ufffdcontracted to supply services\ufffd\ufffd in Maryland, and \ufffd\ufffdtransacted business\ufffd\ufffd there. Assuming that the Maryland \ufffd\ufffdcontracting-to-supply\ufffd\ufffd provision would not apply if the parties didn\ufffdt have a contract at all, estoppel should apply to the question of whether the parties had a contract. The Virginia court held that they did not, so Mora may invoke collateral estoppel to prevent Collins from establishing that they did. They already litigated that issue in the Virginia action, it was decided against Collins, and the issue of whether the parties had a contract is the same in Suit Two. 1  Collins will likely be barred from relitigating the contract issue. The Virginia court also decided that Mora had not \ufffd\ufffdtransacted business\ufffd\ufffd in Virginia, because none of the negotiations concerning the software services took place there. But the issue of whether Mora transacted business in Maryland is different from the issue of whether he did so in Virginia. The Virginia court never decided whether Mora transacted business in Maryland, since that issue was irrelevant to jurisdiction under Virginia\ufffds long-arm statute. Maybe the negotiations did  take place in Maryland, and would support jurisdiction under its \ufffd\ufffdtransacting business\ufffd\ufffd long-arm provision. Collins is not estopped on that question, since it is a different issue from the one he litigated and lost on in the Virginia action. So, estoppel will bar Collins from relying on the contracting prong of the Maryland statute, but not the transacting prong.  C  is right.  A  is wrong, because Collins clearly will not be estopped from arguing that Mora transacted business in Maryland.  B  is also wrong, because he  will  be estopped on the contracting provision, since the Virginia court concluded that no contract was formed. But how about  D ? Isn\ufffdt it true that this case was never decided on the merits, since it was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction? That is true, but the issue of whether the parties had a contract was still litigated, decided, and necessary to the judgment dismissing the Virginia action. There is no point in allowing relitigation of that issue, even though the ultimate disposition of the case was a judgment of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. A decision \ufffd\ufffdon the merits\ufffd\ufffd is a requirement for res judicata, but not for collateral estoppel. A factual finding that leads to a jurisdictional dismissal may be the basis for estoppel on that factual issue in a later action.",

Area defends on the ground that Cameco, the Area employee who had negotiated the contract, had no authority to bind the company, and that Area had notified O\ufffdHara that it would not honor the agreement. The judge grants summary judgment for O\ufffdHara, finding that Cameco, as a sales agent for Area, had implied authority to enter into the contract. She orders specific performance of the contract. In the third year of the contract, Area again refuses to perform. This time it seeks to avoid the contract by arguing that there was a mutual mistake as to the acreage covered by the contract, because Cameco had not understood that it was to include acreage rented by O\ufffdHara to other farmers.

Area will be estopped from raising this defense, because it could have been raised in the first action. D.  Area will be estopped from raising this defense, since the prior judgment determined that the contract was valid.",
            "Analysis": "In the previous chapter, we saw that res judicata bars relitigation even of claims that were not raised in the prior action, if they could have been raised. But that isn\ufffdt true of collateral estoppel; it only bars an issue if it was litigated and decided in the prior action. Here, the issue of Cameco\ufffds authority to enter into the contract was litigated and decided, but the mutual mistake issue was not. It could have been raised there, but it wasn\ufffdt.  C  is wrong, because collateral estoppel will only bar litigation in a second action of issues that were actually litigated and decided in the first. B  suggests that the first action can\ufffdt have collateral estoppel effect because it was resolved on summary judgment, not after trial. Not so; issues decided by judges have the same collateral estoppel effect as issues decided by juries. (In the first question, the issues were decided by the judge, too.) When a judge enters summary judgment on an issue, she decides that one party is entitled to win on it, because there is no dispute of fact and its position is established as a matter of law. For example, the judge\ufffds conclusion that Cameco had implied authority to enter into a contract with O\ufffdHara disposes of that issue, and could bar relitigation of the point in a later action. D  is probably wrong too, though there\ufffds an intelligent argument for it. The argument runs like this: \ufffd\ufffdThe parties litigated the validity of the contract in Suit One. It was held valid. So Area can\ufffdt relitigate that issue.\ufffd\ufffd But this states the issue litigated in Suit One at too high a level of generality. The issue actually litigated in the first action was whether the contract was invalid because Cameco lacked authority to enter into it. If we precluded Area from arguing mutual mistake in Suit Two because it argued lack of authority in Suit One, Area would have to raise all possible defenses to the contract in Suit One, or lose them all in Suit Two. This might actually lead to an  increase  in litigation, since parties would have to assert every possible defense in the first case or lose the omitted defenses in later actions. Instead, courts focus on the specific issue\ufffdhere, Cameco\ufffds implied authority\ufffdthat the parties did raise and litigate in the prior action, and bar relitigation of that defense, but not other defenses to the contract that Area might have raised but did not.

            "Analysis": "D  is a dog. The whole point of collateral estoppel is to preclude relitigation of issues when they arise in other actions and different contexts. As long as the issue of Gillespie\ufffds negligence was litigated and decided in the prior action, it is fair to preclude Renfrow from litigating it again, even if he is raising the issue to defeat Gillespie\ufffds claim rather than to establish his own. There is no requirement that the plaintiff be the same in both actions, or that the estopped party litigate the issue to establish liability (as opposed to a defense) in both actions. The crux of the matter is, again, \ufffd\ufffdwhat issue was litigated and decided in Suit One?\ufffd\ufffd How we define the original issue will determine the scope of preclusion. If we define the issue as, \ufffd\ufffdDid Renfrow prove that Gillespie was negligent with the evidence he submitted in Suit One?\ufffd\ufffd then the issue isn\ufffdt the same in the second suit, since Renfrow now offers different evidence to establish that Gillespie ran the light. But a little thought suggests that defining the issue in Suit One that narrowly would pretty much eviscerate collateral estoppel. A party who lost on an issue before would simply offer slightly different evidence to prove the point, and argue that he can\ufffdt be estopped. This is not going to fly. If the issue is the same one that was litigated before, the loser will be precluded on it, even though she argues that she could do a better job of proving it the second time. No court will allow Renfrow to relitigate whether Gillespie ran the light, just because he claims he\ufffdll offer more evidence the second time. 2  Indeed, the specter of collateral estoppel (and res judicata) is what gives parties the incentive to do it right the  first  time. So,  C  is also wrong, since estoppel will apply to the jury\ufffds finding that Gillespie didn\ufffdt run the light. But how about his other argument, that Gillespie was negligent in swerving into his car, instead of turning the other way? Is this a new issue, or is it simply another argument in support of his prior claim that Gillespie\ufffds negligence contributed to the accident? Very likely, a court would hold that the issue litigated in the prior action was \ufffd\ufffdwhether negligence of Gillespie was a cause of the accident,\ufffd\ufffd rather than \ufffd\ufffdwhether negligence of Gillespie in running the red light was a cause of the accident.\ufffd\ufffd Presumably, Renfrow would have pleaded the defense at this level of generality, and would be expected to produce all the evidence he had of negligent acts by Gillespie. See generally Restatement (Second) of Judgments \ufffd27, Ill. 4. If the court accepted the more specific ran-the-light formulation of the issue, it would allow Renfrow to relitigate the cause of the accident time and again by coming up with other negligent acts Gillespie may have committed. Since any negligence by Gillespie would bar his recovery, Renfrow should raise all his arguments for negligence in the first action, or be estopped from switching to new arguments in support of this issue in a later one. While we have to limit estoppel to the issues actually litigated, we don\ufffdt have to break an issue like \ufffd\ufffdGillespie\ufffds negligence\ufffd\ufffd down into atomic particles and limit estoppel to individual bits of evidence about it. Thus,  A  is the best answer. The parties litigated the issue of Gillespie\ufffds negligence in Suit One. Renfrow lost on that issue, and will be estopped from relitigating it in Suit Two. Admittedly, there is a subtle line between a new issue, illustrated in Question 2 , and a new argument in support of the same issue, illustrated here.

But not all states make counterclaims compulsory, so this scenario could happen in a number of courts, and used to arise in many. The key to estoppel questions is to look back at Suit One, to determine what issues were litigated and decided in that suit. Here, the question indicates that the parties litigated the negligence of Watkins and of Pasquale. Both issues were raised in the pleadings, and evidence about both parties\ufffd negligence was submitted to the finder of fact. But that isn\ufffdt enough to support estoppel. We also have to figure out  what the jury decided  about those issues. Did they find Watkins negligent (which would preclude him from recovery)?

This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let\ufffds try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey , 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well.  What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria\ufffds suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn\ufffdt the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria\ufffds suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for  his  injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn\ufffdt a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey\ufffds negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in  Cambria v. Jeffrey  held that Jeffrey could  litigate it again, because the judge\ufffds finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not \ufffd\ufffdnecessary to the judgment.\ufffd\ufffd  What finding  was  necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it\ufffds clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because  he  (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win,  whether the defendant was negligent or not . Thus, Cambria\ufffds negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn\ufffdt affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can\ufffdt have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that  leads to  the judgment in the case. There\ufffds another problem with findings that don\ufffdt lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable:  Put yourself in Jeffrey\ufffds shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries.  If Jeffrey appealed the judge\ufffds finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, \ufffd\ufffdWhat are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn\ufffdt change the outcome, so why should we  waste  our  time  reviewing  an  irrelevant conclusion?\ufffd\ufffd And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn\ufffdt likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey\ufffds negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge\ufffds finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can\ufffdt be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it.

            "Question": "8. Here we go again.  Arrowmark Products Company sues Sentry Manufacturing Company for trademark infringement. Arrowmark claims that Sentry is liable for trademark infringement, because it used a logo for its products that is the same as one on which Arrowmark holds a trademark, and sold the products in Arrowmark\ufffds market area. Sentry admits using the logo, but argues that Arrowmark\ufffds trademark is invalid and that it did not sell its products in Arrowmark\ufffds market area, so it did not infringe the trademark anyway. The case is tried to a jury, which returns a special verdict specifying its findings on the issues. It finds that Arrowmark\ufffds trademark is valid. It also finds that Sentry did not sell in Arrowmark\ufffds market area. Consequently, the judge enters judgment for Sentry.

            "Analysis": "D  as in Dog once more. Sentry\ufffds defense in the second case challenges the same trademark that was challenged in the first case. The question is whether that trademark is valid, just as it was in the first suit. It is true, as  B  states, that the trademark issue was decided in the first suit, but that is not sufficient to allow estoppel. The finding must also, as Cambria v. Jeffrey  illustrates, be necessary to the judgment in the earlier case. And the decision here that Arrowmark\ufffds trademark is valid was not necessary to the judgment in its first suit against Sentry. Arrowmark did not win because the jury found its trademark valid. It did not win  at all . The judgment in the suit was for Sentry, on the ground that it did not infringe the trademark because it did not sell in Arrowmark\ufffds market area. So the finding that the trademark was valid did not lead to the judgment that ended the case; indeed, it would tend to support a different judgment. Thus, while that issue was litigated and decided in Suit One, Sentry will be able to relitigate the issue in the later action. Both  A  and  B are wrong;  C  is the best answer. This doesn\ufffdt seem to make sense. At trial, the parties don\ufffdt know whether the jury will find that Sentry sold in Arrowmark\ufffds market area, so they have every incentive to litigate the other issue\ufffdvalidity\ufffd aggressively. The jury\ufffds decision on the validity issue could well lead to the judgment\ufffdfor either party. And the jury, who may not understand much about how their factual findings will be used to fashion a final judgment, probably gave the validity issue as serious consideration as the infringement issue. Why relitigate it later? The jury may have considered the validity issue seriously. But they may have concluded first that there was no infringement, so given validity less thought. Even if they did conscientiously decide the issue, Sentry can\ufffdt appeal it, since it won the case. So, while there\ufffds an argument for giving estoppel effect to findings like this, it has not generally been accepted by the courts.",

            "Context": "The cases we\ufffdve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \ufffd\ufffdmutual collateral estoppel,\ufffd\ufffd because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \ufffd\ufffdmutuality\ufffd\ufffd doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is  Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore , 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel,  all courts  adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn\ufffdt be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used  against  a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here\ufffds a case that makes the point.",

Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful\ufffds brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall\ufffds claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall\ufffds, that Faithful\ufffds brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit.

Carmichael was not a party to the prior action and therefor cannot be estopped on the issue.",
            "Analysis": "Scratch  C  from the beginning. The finding that the brochure did not promise a particular rate of return  was  necessary to the judgment. Gotschall based his claim on the fact that the brochure promised a 15 percent return, and he lost his case  because  the judge found that the brochure did not promise a specific rate of return, so that finding of fact did lead to the judgment. It was not dicta; it was the very basis for the decision that Gotschall could not recover. A  suggests that Carmichael is barred because he should have joined as a coplaintiff with Gotschall. However, while Rule 20(a) would allow him to join in that suit, it does not require him to do so; Rule 20(a) is permissive. (In fact there might be various reasons why Carmichael could not have joined, such as diversity problems.) More practically, who says he even knew about Gotschall\ufffds action? It would be a tough rule that forced him to join even though he never learned of the other case! B  argues that he is barred because the requirements for collateral estoppel are met\ufffdthe issue is the same, it was actually litigated in suit one and decided by the court.

This is indeed a \ufffd\ufffdfirst principle\ufffd\ufffd: No party will be estopped (absent some form of privity) until she has had her day in court. My students frequently lose sight of this fundamental, ineluctable requirement for applying issue preclusion. Always ask whether the party who is being barred from litigating the issue litigated it before. If not, no estoppel! Estoppel\ufffdin a mutuality jurisdiction or in a non-mutuality jurisdiction\ufffdonly bars a party from  relitigating  an issue, not from litigating it for the first time.  D is right.",

However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \ufffd\ufffdmutuality\ufffd\ufffd doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is  Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore , 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel,  all courts  adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn\ufffdt be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used  against  a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here\ufffds a case that makes the point.",
            "Question": "11. Investment in litigation. Gotschall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc. on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that the brochure fraudulently promised a 15 percent rate of return on his investment. He also alleged that his contract with Faithful agreed to return his money after one year if the fund had not made a profit during the year, which Faithful had subsequently refused to do. Faithful denied both claims. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the contract did not guarantee any particular rate of return. However, she also found that the contract did provide for a refund at the close of the first year if there had not been a profit. The court entered judgment awarding no damages to Gotschall for misrepresentation, but ordering return of his original investment. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, learned of the action and sued Faithful for breach of contract and fraud, raising the same two claims that Gotschall had asserted in his suit. Faithful raised the same defenses. Under federal collateral estoppel principles, the court would probably",
            "Options": "Options: A. bar Carmichael from relitigating either issue, based on issue preclusion, since the same issues were already litigated and decided in Gotschall\ufffds action.\nB. allow Carmichael to relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, since Carmichael has not litigated that issue.\nC. allow Faithful to relitigate whether the contract provided for a refund after one year, because they have not litigated that issue against Carmichael.\nD. require Carmichael to relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, because the finding in Faithful\ufffds favor on that issue was not necessary to the judgment in the prior action.",
            "Analysis": "D is wrong. Gotschall sued for the 15 percent profit he claimed he was entitled to. But he didn\ufffdt get it, because the court held he wasn\ufffdt entitled to it. He lost on this claim because of the court\ufffds ruling against him on his misrepresentation claim. Thus, that finding was necessary to the judgment denying him those damages. He got his original investment back but did not collect the alleged profits. C is close. Faithful litigated and lost on the issue of the right to return of the principal in Gotschall\ufffds suit. So the first requirement for estoppel is met\ufffdthe party to be estopped litigated and lost on the issue in the prior action. But we know from Parklane that the court does not automatically estop a party just because they litigated and lost on the issue in the prior action. The trial court will consider whether estopping Faithful is fair under the circumstances. Here it probably is. Both actions are in federal court, so Faithful is not likely to have a better procedural opportunity to prevail on the return-of-principal issue in the second action. There are no inconsistent judgments. And Carmichael did not hang back to see whether Gotschall would win on the issue\ufffdthe question indicates that he only learned of Gotschall\ufffds suit after it was over. So the federal court probably would allow Carmichael to estop Faithful on the issue. So C is probably not right. B takes the prize. Carmichael, as a new party, has not litigated whether the brochure promised a 15 percent return, so he will get his chance to do that, even though Gotschall failed to prove it in his action.",
            "generated_text": "### Question-Context Steps:\n{QC 1} Gotschall sued Faithful for breach of contract (promising a refund if no profit) and fraud (misrepresenting a 15% return).\n{QC 2} The court found no fraud (no guaranteed return rate), but found a breach of contract (refund promised).\n{QC 3} Carmichael, a new investor, sued Faithful raising the same claims as Gotschall.\n{QC 4} Federal collateral estoppel principles apply.\n{QC 5}  Under non-mutual collateral estoppel, the party being estopped must have litigated and lost the issue in the prior suit.  {QC 6} In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used against a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit.\n\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\nStep 1: The question asks whether Carmichael can relitigate the issues decided in Gotschall's case against Faithful under federal collateral estoppel principles. {QC 3, QC 4}\n\nStep 2: Federal courts generally allow non-mutual collateral estoppel under certain conditions, as established in *Parklane Hosiery*. {QC 4, Context}\n\nStep 3: A key requirement for non-mutual collateral estoppel is that the party being estopped (Faithful) must have litigated and lost the issue in the prior suit. {QC 5}\n\nStep 4:  Faithful litigated and lost on the issue of whether the contract provided for a refund.  {QC 1, QC 2}  Therefore, under non-mutual collateral estoppel, Faithful is estopped from relitigating this issue against Carmichael. {QC 6}\n\nStep 5: Faithful litigated and won on the issue of whether the brochure guaranteed a 15% return. {QC 1, QC 2}  Carmichael, not having been a party to the first suit, is not estopped from litigating this issue. {QC 3, QC 6}\n\nStep 6: Option A is incorrect because Carmichael can relitigate the fraud claim (15% return).\nStep 7: Option B is correct because Carmichael can relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, as they were not a party to the original case.\nStep 8: Option C is incorrect because Faithful is estopped from relitigating the breach of contract claim (refund).\nStep 9: Option D is incorrect because the finding on the 15% return, although favorable to Faithful, was not necessary to the judgment in the prior action (the judgment was based on the contract breach).  The focus is on whether Faithful litigated and lost on each issue, not the necessity of the finding to the judgment.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the court would likely allow Carmichael to relitigate whether the brochure guaranteed a 15 percent rate of return, but would bar them from relitigating the breach of contract issue.  This aligns with option B.\n\nFinal Answer: B\n"
